audiophile,"Hey everyone,

My late father was a DJ in socal throughout the 70s-90s and was obviously pretty big into music. He had a pair of RSL speakers that he never told me the name of before he passed. Are there any audiophiles that has some knowledge on vintage RSL speakers???


Also, i spliced some RCA cables to see if they even worked, and they did, but they are extremely quiet even with everything on full and running it through my 48v mixer. (it almost sounds like it is just the tweeter). Does anyone know if im missing something?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. :)

Here are some photos of the speakers:

audiophile,I recently bought a Dual Kicker Comp R 12‚Äù sub and Audiocontrol LC-1.800 amp and I think they sound good but I have been having a problem since install where it will randomly make a constant windy air sound usually when I get in my car and it persists for about 2-3 minutes even when no music is playing. It will also do it as I‚Äôm driving every now and then. I took it in to where I had it installed and the guy disabled the ANC in my car because he thought my subs were picking up on it but that didn‚Äôt fix the problem. Would anyone have any idea why this is happening?
audiophile,Hi I'm a beginner to this space and I just wanted some help regarding what's the best piece of headphones/earphones for trying to fall asleep to some brown noise?
audiophile,"I'm currently looking for a new power amp, and would love to get a more efficient class D option, but can't afford the range-topping class D amps. 

I see pro-ject, the German brand seem to mainly make class D amplifiers (aside from their turntables), however, there isn't much information on how they perform! 

Anyone experienced the Amp box DS2 stereo power amp, or any of their other amplifiers? Retails for ¬£599 in the UK. 

How do they hold up compared to class A/B competitors at similar prices like the Emotiva BasX series?"
audiophile,"i was wondering which is the best option for over-ear headphones under 200‚Ç¨ (wireless if possible) because reading articles only creates confusion: a lot of them are clearly paid by the companies and some of them are just dumb (one i read put a 400$ headphone in first place and a 40$ headphone in second).
I mostly listen to metal and really live being able to tell the instruments apart; especially the bass which gets almost removed in mixing"
audiophile,Don't kill the messenger... I usually just like to talk about what I know and when I don't know I ask. Today I was talking to a man who repairs very high-end speakers and I asked him for more expensive cables and he started laughing and asked me: more expensive how? 15 - 50‚Ç¨ or 250 to 2500‚Ç¨? And I replied ‚Ç¨250 top and he once again laughed and said to me: Have you seen the cables used to connect the woofer drivers and tweeters to the crossovers? Cables are 0.50 cents per meter in speakers from 250$ to 75000$ now draw your conclusions... What is your opinion on this matter?
audiophile,"Hello, so I just bought my first subwoofer (Jamo c912) and I noticed that in in the right corner behind where I sit the bass is very loud when I go to that corner my whole body shakes and when I sit back to my desk I feel like there is almost no bass compared to that corner. I tried to place the sub in different locations but it's always loud in that corner am I doing something wrong and placing my sub in bad spots ? I also tried to move it to that corner but it's still same. Thank you for your answers."
audiophile,"I have a B&amp;K AV1260 amp.  The manual makes reference to bridging 6 of the amps into a single channel.  There are some internal jumper settings to make the whole bank of 6 a single, but I only need to bridge 2 or 3 for 120W or 180W.  Has anyone done this before?  Thanks."
audiophile,"I've been curious about this upcoming addition to the Wharfedale Heritage series since it was teased last year. They are due out next month, and it looks like the approximate U.S. price will be $7,000. Not too far out of line from the UK price of ¬£5,500, but quite a bit more than the Lintons.

Curious what others think. Anyone champing at the bit for these at that price?"
audiophile,"Hi all, today I just bought a new turntable and new speakers. I decided to switch them out today. My amplifiers are the arcam alpha 8 and the 8 power amp together so I bi amp my speakers. The new speakers are the q acoustic 3050. I‚Äôm not sure whether they should normally pair well together and that‚Äôs the problem? But let me tell you what happened.

so basically today I had the record playing with my old speakers and thought I‚Äôd switch the speakers out first. So unplugged them and then plugged in the new ones. Only thing was I plugged the banana plugs straight in through the holes instead of untwisting and going through the sides of the speakers? And also I left the metal connector on on the speakers when connecting them although though I‚Äôm biwiring them? Not sure whether that causes a problem?

Anyway I Turned the pre amp on and heard distortion and then turned the power amp on and really loud distortion and both amplifier just died. I did see the speaker tweeter move a bit like the cone just hoping the speakers haven‚Äôt gone?Only other thing I can think of is are the impedance not matched on the speakers and amp?? Any solutions or help would be much appreciated cheers."
audiophile,So I‚Äôve just come back from the Bristol Hi-Fi show. They had a demonstration room setup with a pair of Lockwood speakers powered by a Quad tube amp. They played When The Levee Breaks by Led Zeppelin and I think it was by far the best hi fi experience I‚Äôve ever had. Shame they‚Äôre ¬£9k a pair though.
audiophile,"I have a Best Buy gift card and am thinking of upgrading my center channel.  My system is mostly used for home theater but I splurge on the L &amp; R for music listening (currently have Bowers &amp; Wilkins 700 series).  Currently I have a Polk Audio CSM for a center channel that does it's job but I'm thinking it feels a bit boxy.  I don't particularly like the sound of the B&amp;W centers I've heard so I was wondering what would make a nice compliment to them rather than the matching set.

Here's what I'm looking at right now:

* Dali Oberon Vokal
*  Dali Spektor Vokal
* ELAC Debut Rerference
* ELAC Debut 2.0 Dual
* ELAC Carina
* Klipsch Next Gen Reference Series Quad 3.5""
* Martin Logan Motion 4""
* Martin Logan Motion 3.5""

Anyone have any opinions on these in relation to the B&amp;Ws?  Or is there anything that's Juuuuust a little pricier that I should splurge for?"
audiophile,"I tested this open back headphones on various sources. 
Note: Make sure to have decent sound card, if you have high end motherboard, you don't need dac really, I didn't experience any noise, I have ALC1220-VB up to date. 

So the basic formula for best experience:
Decent source -&gt; decent output -&gt; decent headphones
Atmos won't help much if you had let's say, outdated card. 

My rating of equalizer settings -action movies-
Balanced&gt;Off&gt;detailed&gt;warm. And this is subjective btw. 

-When to use Atmos: 

HQ Audio either FLAC or PCM as from Bluray. You want the sound to be crisp and minimally compressed to begin with.

Action-Packed and thriller Movies -it will add some depth to the effects, and enhance the üí•.

Animated or video game based media, I feel it fits the virtual immersive mode that atmos create more. 

Some games, it really varies greatly you just need to turn it on and off to figure out if it suits you. Though I feel it works better with closed-back myself. 

-When not to use Atmos: 

Music -Just don't it'll be less natural.

LQ audio as in webrip -the unclarity¬†will be amplified it might be annoying for some.¬† 

Movies with mostly dialouges as in slice of life etc. Feels more pitchy, on longer duration it might irritating.

Youtube in general, except if you want to test atmos videos. 

Verdict: Keep Atmos and other spacial softwares off most of the time, except for movies and supported games."
audiophile,"Just purchased a Yamaha r-s202 receiver, audio-technica turntable (with preamp), and Sony speakers. The volume on the receiver needs to be up to around 50 for decent sound. If I turn it down to 20, you can barely hear anything. Anyone have experience with this?"
audiophile,What are some really efficient speakers that are not horns?
audiophile,"So I'm jumping into this audiophile world and the first thing that I've been trying to figure out is preamp vs amp vs integrated amp vs receiver vs av receiver vs dac. and its pretty confusing. I currently bought a integrated amp/receiver that also has a dac (side note: doesn't everything have a dac if its playing any sort of digital files? could you play a digital file/stream without a dac?)

and anyway. im watching reviews online of different receivers, and they talk about all of the inputs on the back and some of the reviewers go on about all of the analog inputs (a lot of receivers have a ton of analog inputs on the back seemingly). but im just like. what the hell is an analog device at this point?

the onlyyyy thing I can think of is vinyl or maybe a casette tape? but then after that. is anything analog? like. even a CD player. isn't a CD digital?"
audiophile,"Moved house and now renovating the front room.

Currently using soundbar and sub.

I don't want stand-up speakers.

Either want hang on the wall or ceiling speakers.

Would it be the same without a subwoofer having the wall/ceiling speakers?

I'm new to this. What do people recommend?

Any help would be greatly appreciated :)

audiophile,"I recently switched from Samsung Galaxy to Google Pixel.
Problem is that the Pixel - unlike galaxy devices - does not have Dolby Atmos support.
My question is: Are there any Dolby enabled DAC's ouy there that can help me play Dolby content, and thus bypassing the Pixel's lack of Dolby support?
In other words: Does the Dolby encoding happen to the signal before it gets sent to the DAC for conversion or does it happen on the device first, and then gets sent to the DAC?"
audiophile,"this decides whether I buy the Mx5. Is there a way to use the dac from the mx5 whilst using the tube amp from the littledot mark 2? If so please tell me ways of setting this up. If not any reconmendations on Dac Amp Stacks that can power both headphones an speakers?

audiophile,"Hello, 

After testing the version of [Saint-Sa√´ns' Symphony No. 3 recorded in 2015 with the Kansas City Symphony](https://magicvinyldigital.net/2023/01/14/saint-saens-symphony-no-3-with-organ-kansas-city-symphony-review-vinyl-sacd-hdcd-qobuz-sacd-5-1/), this review focuses on Charles Munch's version of Saint-Sa√´ns' Symphony No. 3, recorded with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1959.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r0f8phuonjka1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=48023fb951e196070acfa82fbfb7c0794198ea4f

The versions 6 tested are : CD layer of SACD, SACD stereo, SACD 3.0, HDTT DXD, Qobuz Hi-Res and vinyl Analogue Production.

The versions are dynamic with a DR12 and from master in DSD except for the vinyl which is pure analog. The curve below compares the spectra of vinyl and SACD. The yellow arrow indicates the rise in noise above 30 kHz in the SACD due to the DSD64 encoding. The vinyl has a noise rise and a peak around 30 kHz. The sound of the two versions is similar.

&amp;#x200B;

[SACD vs Vinyl](https://preview.redd.it/165qnraqnjka1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=35e4f8afc0d5e9879b264752a3977993609e12af)

It is also interesting to compare the performance of this version of Charles Munch's Symphony No. 3 with the 2015 version with the Kansas City Symphony. The 1959 version, despite the date of its recording, is certainly one of the best interpretations.

Listening to it, we find a vinyl of very good quality but which cannot match the digital versions in the silence of the quietest passages. A small curiosity is the 3.0 version which brings a beautiful energy of the front sound scene.

To compare and listen to the different editions, you can find some samples and all the measurements [here](https://magicvinyldigital.net/2023/02/26/saint-saens-symphony-no-3-with-organ-charles-munch-and-boston-symphony-1959-review-cd-sacd-sacd-3-0-vinyl-hdtt-and-qobuz-hi-res/).

audiophile,"Hello,

I want to buy a powerful surround sound system for my PC. My budget is around $300-400.

When I looked at the products in the market, I saw that the Logitech Z906 is a strong product, but I have questions about this product. The release date of this product is very old, so i wonder is its technology also old?

Also, when I looked at the user comments, I saw that the device has a heating problem, do you have any information about it?

TL;DR: I'm asking if Z906 still good product and worth buying?

Thank you."

Since I do not have information on the amplifier used how can I compare them? Thanks üôè

audiophile,"I am looking fir good wireless headphones. i have an analog audio deck(behringer xenix 802) set up to my pc and tv and i want a good pair of wireless headphones since i am getting very annoyed by the wire i am using on my sony xm4.

I asume i am looking for something with a audio box from the headphone or something. i would prefer something with decent passive(i doubt there is something like this with active) noise canceling.

audiophile,"I recently moved my home theater system into our living room. I will upload a picture later today. I have had to make a lot of tweaks or adjustments to the receiver such as speaker distance, channel level adjustments for my 5.1 minus the 1 because my sub power supply decided to take a crap. Anyways I am reaching out because I am losing all my Mid-range from the towers. Overall the system sounds really weak mostly highs. My setup is klipsch reference series, 2 towers with 2 - 8‚Äù, a center and 2 surround. The living is one long room that runs north to south. Tv is above a fire place and mantle with center speaker mounted under the mantle, the towers are placed beside the fireplace and of course surround facing the tv just behind our couch on each side. The placement of the towers is what I‚Äôm struggling with and feel that because of the fireplace walls putting them in a corner basically the sound is bounce away from the seating area. I hope that makes sense. Needing help our some ideas to fix this.

audiophile,"I recently got some pc38x headphones with the intent to dip my toes into the audiophile community. I wasn't really sure if I needed an amp or dac or anything, but I hooked them up to my laptop and they sound noticably better than when listening on my desktop. The laptop is a 2018 Thinkpad x1 carbon and the desktop motherboard is a modern b550i, and the motherboard alone costs more than the laptop, so I really expected the desktop to sound a lot better.

I mostly listen to EDM and a little phonk and rock. I turned up the base a little bit in Spotify EQ settings and on my laptop, the songs I listen to sound SIGNIFICANTLY better than my old headphones (Bose 700s and a Lenovo gaming headset) or my airpods. There is way more base and it sounds less boring/flat (idk if that's the proper use of ""flat"") but on my desktop, even if I turn up the base in EQ, it still doesn't get close to as good as it sounds on my laptop.

How can I get better sound on my desktop? Do I get an amp? I definitely don't have room for a sound card in my PC. Also, I was considering getting a portable dac/amp for my phone, any options on that?

Thanks, and please remember I don't know much about audio so if I said something dumb please go easy on me, lol."

I am looking to buy speakers for my desk setup any recommendations?

Answer is yes (not for mp3 users)
Tested on Lg G8x (stock music app)

 Kingston v10 std micro sd card vs Lexar v30 micro sd std card

Speed cbdt app test: (varies depend upon sd reader hardware)

A)kingston write n read(29MB/p,81MB/p)
B)Lexar write n read.    (52MB/p,127MB/p)

1)Flac: v10 couldnt handle 24bit 48khz n upper format than this .instant pausing audio n resuming it at same gave me a distortion.on Lexar(v30 card) had no problem upto 32 bit 192khz(7MB/p need)

2)Cue file: most of cue i have format 32bit 384khz which didnt sound as perfect as it should hv asking speed average 18000kbps(18MB/p need) kingston handle it at average quality n lexar was near to perfect but depend upon if sd card is working on other files or not at that time..

3)Dsd native: kingston(v10) couldnt handle dsd it had lot of distortion (at time plying it u cant check photos from same sd card it take lot of time to load)
V30 able handle dsd 64 dsd 128 both but not as perfect internal storage can handle (photos n video was loading in gallery)

Conclusion:
Sd do make difference in audio quality in hi res format 
Dsd sound good in v30 card but need more speed to read file faster than u can play that file going forward n backword make it worse 
Suggestion:

Use internal storage(ssd storage) for dsd level audio"

audiophile,"Okay, sorry if this is obvious. I have a pair of Monitor Audio Bronze 50‚Äôs and just think they look so much cleaner and elegant with the dust covers on. However, does this affect the sound quality at all? Should I remove them when listening to them? Surely it must block some of the frequencies coming from the speaker?"
audiophile,"I‚Äôm thinking of replacing my current setup (separates and passive speakers) with a modern active system.¬†

My current setup is a Linn Klimax renew ds1 streamer, Dansen Beat 150xs, Rega P6 turntable with a Rega Aria, Trichord Diablo RIIA and Spendor A6r speakers. This has served med really well for a number of years and I am really happy with how it sounds.¬†

But, there are a lot of boxes and a lot of cables. We live in an apartment and my girlfriend - and to a certain extent me - would like a less cluttered livingroom. I am prepared to sacrifice a little bit of sound quality to achieve this, but not too much :)

My question is, what would I loose if I sold my current setup and bought a pair of active bookshelf speakers. Buchardt A500 is high on the list, but KEF, Klipsch, System Audio and - shudder - Sonos 5 are also alternatives.¬†

I have for a long time thought of Sonos as the new Bose, and have completely disregarded it. But a few weeks ago I visited a friend. He had just purchased a pair of Sonos 5. He was really thrilled with them and surprised with how good they sounded ang how engaging the were. It is worth mentioning that my friend is one of the top producers/mixers in my country. He really knows his stuff. Sound is of course a personal preference, but I tend to take notes when he speaks about hi fi. So when he demoed a lot of speakers and picked the Sonos 5 (which was also half his budget), they sudden became an alternative for me. Although I¬† am admittedly more drawn to the Buchardt A500. I will of course demo before I buy.

My question to you all is, what would I loose going from my old system to for example the Sonos or the Buchard system? My guess is clarity, details and nuances. But I‚Äôm uncertain as to how big the drop in audio quality would be.

What would I gain? My guess is ease of use, less clutter and the benefits of DSP and room correction software.¬†

Has anyone here made a similar transition, and how did it turn out for you?"

What's stopping you from listening to audio on both at the same time with maybe the 5.1 quieter, as you'll get the quality of the headphones and some more dynamic range. 

Does it just sound like sh*t listening to two sources at once as the sound isn't perfectly synced up or is there a way around that. Is this a terrible question?"
audiophile,"I'm currently using the Anker Souncore Q30s and have no major complaints, but the headband is now cracked in a few places after a few years. 

Is it worth upgrading to the new Sony WH-CH720Ns?"
audiophile,"I've recently done some big upgrades on my turntable setup looking for a euphoric listening experience! Unfortunately my upgrades have made the sound quality too crisp, which can be cool at lower volumes but when I really crank it, it's just kinda grating. 

I was initially using just my AT-LP120 and its internal pre-amp going into a Yamaha receiver with Polk RTI A1's sitting on my entertainment system. Then I got some Primacoustic Recoil Stabilizers for my speakers which helped tremendously. And after doing a lot of research I upgraded my cartridge to a VM540ML and got a Music Fidelity V90-LPS external phono pre-amp. After setting all that up I popped on a Slowdive record and it was like listening to it for the first time. Absolute heaven.

Then I got greedy and spent 2 hours with my brother removing the internal preamp to my AT-LP120. After all that, I hate to say it's just too damn crisp. Crazy how the entire internet is orgasming over this mod - I know it's technically a less inhibited sound, but I prefer a warmer (and honestly flatter) sound than this. 

Should I spend another 2 hours on a reverse vasectomy?? Is that just going backwards? Do I need to shell out on a nice EQ? New turntable? Is there a weak link in my chain?

Thank you in advance to my fellow sound titans üôè"

I'm a casual gamer who's been using a HyperX Revolver S headset through a SBX G6 for the last 5 years and it's time for an upgrade. I've got an office a Gaming/Streaming/Recording (Ext Mic) desktop setup, and woud like some advice and suggestions as to which Headphones I should get next. 

My budget is ‚Ç¨150-200. I mainly game but also listen to music and podcasts/audiobooks while working/writing and occasionally streaming. 

I've always wanted a pair of Beyerdynamics  DT 770 as the quality and price seem to hit the sweet spot for me. However I'm also thinking about gettting a pair of open back cans (do we still call headphones cans?) like the DT 990s as well. Then I saw that there were semi open backs?? And now Im Just confused.

Im by no means an audiophile, but the Revolvers + G6 was a gamechanger, which is why I now want to  invest in a good(great) pair of headphones. Which is why I turn to you in hopes of getting some good advice. Like what qualities I should look for in a good pair of cans (Im just doing it), and what pitfalls and sales tricks to avoid.  

So TL;DR: Im looking for new cans, budget is 150-200, purpose gaming, are open backs worth it?, what should I look for in a good/great pair of cans?

audiophile,"I hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to the HomePod since the initial release because it was limited to be an Apple Music streaming box. I started looking into it when I heard about the new release. But more importantly, the possibility of using a pair as a stereo AirPlay device in macOS.

It had been a while since I was looking for the perfect transportable audio setup, as I am always on the go. I like neutral sound; at home, I have KEF LS50 speakers with a NuPrime amp and the go Campfire Ara IEMs with a Dragonfly DAC/amp. Finding a good comprise that would allow good sound and the possibility of being transported in a suitcase by plane was challenging. I had been thinking of going with an Apollo Twin and small bookshelves from either PreSonus or Neumann. But it was still a lot of weight, and the setup would not go very low.

I went to the Apple Store for a listening session, but unfortunately, laying HomePods on a table 50 cm below the ears with ambient noise does not do the trick. I ended up coming back home with two.

After setting them up as pair and selecting the output in macOS, I opened the Audio Midi Setup to check the bitrate and depth. I was pretty sure I heard AirPlay2 was bringing lossless, but there are some nuances ([Apple AirPlay 2 supports 24-bit lossless audio, but you can‚Äôt use it | digitaltrends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/apple-homepod-24-bit-lossless-audio-airplay-2/)), and we are stuck at 16bit 44.1kHz. Figure out the logic behind being in the ecosystem (streaming from a MacBook or an iPhone) but still being software lock to the lowest quality. Cherry on the cake is bye-bye streaming the ALAC library, their own lossless codec.

Sound-wise, I admit it‚Äôs impressive! They sound way bigger than they are, the soundstage is excellent. The high feels pretty bright, and the mids are clear. But when it comes to the base, although they are well-defined, they are way too pushed. I check the setting in the Home app to discover that there is an option to reduce bass. It sounds way better; it leaves room for the rest, but it feels like a straight cut below 70Hz. So we are stuck between choosing overkilled lows or no bass; it feels incomprehensible, given the potential of the hardware.

Even with these unpleasant surprises, I will keep the pair of HomePod because it corresponds best to my use case. It‚Äôs an unbeatable form factor for the sound, the DSP is great, and the setup is frictionless. It would not take that much to make the HomePod appealing to a broader audience with a software update that:

* Allow lossless streaming via AirPlay from any Apple device
* Add an EQ setting for the HomePod in Home app"

audiophile,"TL;DR: incredible headphones for the price - they're large but sit on my average sized head very well. Bass is clean, and not over the top; high end is crisp, but not fatiguing. I use them for listening to all genres and recording/mixing all genres.

Purchase:

This was by all means an impulse-buy (I have ADHD) but I've wanted a pair of open backs for years. I did a fair amount of research and settled with these beautiful massive cans.

¬£419 from a UK/EU online seller, or ¬£309 from AliExpress? ...It arrived before Christmas (I ordered end of November) and they are incredible.

The fact that the most commons cons I found were essentially that they are massive says a lot about these beautiful giant ear speakers.

Usage:

These are not for outside use or gym ALTHOUGH I took these to Portugal over Christmas and managed to sunbathe/lie down in a quiet city centre then a park and having these on was beautiful while reading a book.

Listening to a variety of genres:

Jeff Buckley
Andy Shauf
Aphex Twin
Clark
Meshuggah
Car Bomb
Admiral Angry
DjRum
dgoHn
Nils Frahm
Bohren &amp; Der Club of Gore

They handle everything so well, and the bass is so clean it's disgusting. No fatigue with high end which is super crisp. 

Stereo field is amazing - it sounds wide and instrumentation circles around your head beautifully.

I am a drummer and guitarist, and record and mix live/indie/math/metal and produce electronic music as a hobby. They work well across the board and are great mix in, especially electronic and metal where you're playing with a lot of harsh sounds, frequencies, and effects.

 
Look/feel/fit:

I'm 6ft with an average (I think) sized head. If they were any bigger it would be a problem but on the smallest setting [?] they are perfect.

They look lovely, and futuristic. They feel durable. I'd want to take care with the foam pads and ensure you store them safely. The little stand they come with does the job.

If you've got a small head they might be a problem sitting on your ears a little awkwardly but I will measure my skull when I can next do so and add that info to this post.

Video:

The video is recorded with my S10 Lite and you can hear how clear they sound despite being a phone recording.

Song is Rez - Skee Mask Mix.

Best audio purchase I've ever made in my life and I will cherish these for the years to come.

audiophile,"So I‚Äôve seen some active and very expensive bass management solutions (PSI Audio AVAA C20) that utilizes the principles of noise cancellation to treat low end frequency issues.

Having a Mini-DSP I came to wonder if it would be possible to do the same thing for less by getting one or two additional subwoofer, switch the phase 180 and/or digitally fiddle with the delay to compensate for distance‚Äôs to listening area, and then use the eq to target all problem areas of the low end frequency curve. 

Since I haven‚Äôt seen anyone doing this I‚Äôm simply assuming it‚Äôs a bad idea but I‚Äôm not sure why. 

The PSI uses a microphone but I‚Äôm not sure why that would be needed if the phase shifted sub can take part of the same source material through the dsp. 

Appreciate any feedback on these thoughts, thanks!"

audiophile,I wanna be an audiophile and I‚Äôve tried reading guides online but I don‚Äôt understand them at all :(
audiophile,"For the last couple years I‚Äôve had the privilege of getting to jam with a pair of Focal Sopra No. 1, a Moon 340i and a Mytek Brooklyn DAC+ taking digital coax from a Node 2i. Roon or BlueOS or Tidal/Spotify directly. Sometimes Qobuz. Apple Music via a USB DDC. (Phone doesn‚Äôt play nice with this DAC)

After two+ years of using this system, listening to hundreds and hundreds of albums and thousands of songs, I‚Äôve had ups and downs, enjoyed ‚Äúmusic,‚Äù hated ‚Äúmusic,‚Äù had silky smooth treble days and days where the highs were too sharp on all the ‚Äúlesser‚Äù recordings that this system just wasn‚Äôt suited for; or so I thought. 

Patricia Barber and Keith Don‚Äôt Go type stuff almost always sounds amazing on these. Other types of music not so much. They do a lot well but don‚Äôt do it all well. Between weather, biorhythms and differing musical genres sometimes it was all good and more and more it seemed like I was not vibing with the nature of the ultralight metal inverted domes on the Sopras. Absorption panels at first helped awhile back. 

Recently had a talk with a very knowledgeable and kind expert about some of this stuff, after seeing s photo of my room he suggested I move the speakers toward the wall since they were a little too close to the main listening position and far from the wall. Developing the energy in the room in a way that remedied some of this stuff. After a couple tweaks, wow. The magic is back. For a days or two days time. My ears are quite sensitive in general and to fatigue. Taking breaks and moving the speakers to a better placement only did so much. Sharp, on the wrong music. Which I sometimes wanted to also listen to. Not just Diana Krall. 

On a whim, I hooked the Sopras to the Denon x1600h receiver for the 5.2.2 Atmos system that sits along side the stereo.

This thing has been calibrated for the other speakers and the two SVS subs so I just switched the AudyseyXT to bypass the mains. The default is to have some sort of loudness contour on the AVR. 

Point being, that even though I had had done loudness contours and stuff with EQ on the other system, it was like this cheap little AVR with airplay had the right Mojo. Treble wasn‚Äôt so crisp, bass was phat. It sounds like a much larger system with or without subs. I wish I knew what the curve looked like so I could use it elsewhere (it adapts depending on volume)

Now I can integrate the subs better than ever before. High pass at 40 and sub LP at 80. It sounds like a massive, highly detailed system without that sharpness I was running from for the last year. It‚Äôs just enjoyablity instead of analysis. I‚Äôm actually listening to music instead of analyzing gear again. It has been several days and the effect isn‚Äôt fading. I‚Äôm just happier with this the way it is than with a spendy front end/amp. So, stop worrying‚Ä¶love the Denon. Easy enough. 

Also, the Atmos system has never sounded better. It was nutty how good it was. 

What are your stories of being surprised by something that was somehow punching above its weight class? Or where you were pleasantly surprised by a chance configuration like this?"
audiophile,"Measurements of a Sonus Faber Lumina 2 and an Svs Sb 1000 pro in a rectangular room with a large window on the right side and a door on the left side. The room does not have any type of treatment and is 6 meters by 4. The speakers are only 20cm from the wall which causes a bump in the bass that is not visible in these measurements due to the crossover at 80hz. In these measurements a smoothing of 1/24 was applied.

audiophile,"Hi guys,

Apologies if this isn't the right subreddit, I'm hoping someone could help me figure out which will give me the best quality sound for games such as Warzone 2 and Apex Legends.

I recently built a new pc, which has the following

GIGABYTE X570S AORUS ELITE AX

This mobo has the ALC1220-VB sound card in it. I also have installed from my old pc, the following

Asus Xonar SE 5.1-Channel Gaming Audio Card

My headset is Astro A40s TR, I also have the Astro Mixamp Pro TR.

I have optical cables etc. I am basically just wondering out of the combination of hardware that I have, what will give me the best audio quality for Warzone?

Also any advice on EQ settings is appreciated.

Thanks in advanced."

audiophile,"Hi Gang,

I recently moved cross country and brought along my stereo system. When I got it all set back up at the new placed I noticed that audio through multiple channels (but not all) had dropped significantly in quality. I am a novice to having a setup like this, so am hoping to get y‚Äôalls opinion on the issue before pulling the trigger on buying anything new to troubleshoot the issue.

My current set up is:
Onkyo tx-sr393 Receiver
Behringer Microphono PP400 Pre-amp
Infinity R263 Speakers
Fluance RT82 Turntable

Previously, I had used this set up to listen to music one of three ways: Bluetooth, Turntable, or Direct input to computer/ipad. 

All three methods resulted in the same high quality of audio before the move, but after the move audio from both the bluetooth and the turntable now sound muffled, buzzy, noisy, and all around low quality. Curiously, the direct input remains crystal clear and very nice. 

I would assume that the receiver had just been damaged during the move and that I would need to replace it, however since the decrease in quality is not universal it gives me pause.

Like I said I am a novice at this, so please let me know if I missed any crucial details and thank you!"

Everything I have found online says it is a good DAC, to the point people were unhappy Denon replaced it in their avrs because of a shortage of chips. But I'm a little confused because the specs are different from the integra website compared to the chips manufacturers spec sheet. Maybe it doesn't make a difference, but integra says 384 kHz/32-bit Hi-Grade DAC, while the manufacturer says it's 768kHz / 32-bit 8 ch Premium DAC, which is double the khz, but I'm new to this so not really sure what the khz is referring to. Is it possible to have the same model number but lower specs? Maybe an older version? Does it matter lol? TIA."
audiophile,"Looking to build out my first hifi setup. Was thinking used 2-5yr old stuff but I have a soft spot for vintage.

While looking for some used modern stuff that gets recommended a lot Iike ELAC speakers, I found these 70s refurbs for 500 and did some reading into them. I guess they have a bit of a cult following, found some old threads on what amps might pair well and advice to use a valve preamp.

Biggest thing just seems to be meeting their low impedence/high power demand. A more powerful amp+preamp is a bit more than I was aiming at but I'm certainly fine spending more especially for something unique and vintage. If the speakers end up being lemons I can always get something more modern or even new that pairs well with my amp.

Any advice on what I can expect on whether this might be a worthwhile project, what I might expect sound-wise, modern vs vintage, general things, I'm all ears.

Obviously going to go hear them before seriously entertaining anything. I've in a fairly soundproofed apartment, I like to have music on but not always loud, are their any downsides to a lot of quiet listening on this sort of setup?

It is almost impossible to find one locally where i live but i managed to get one with great difficulties.. i knew that i needed a dac or something to power these but I thought to myself I'll just use them with my Phone.

Long story short after i got them i went online now and i am looking for a 6.35mm to 3.5mm adapter or convertor so that i could plug it to my phone ( by pluging that 3.5 into a typr C or Lighting dongle, i know am dumb ). By searching here and there i think now that the guitar cord and the HD800s cord is the same! Am i right ? So i went to a guitar shop and they had the guitar cord to 3.5 and i tried it with my HD800s but sound was coming only from one ear and was low.

I just want you guys to guide me and tell me what to do cause AM FUCKING LOST. I don't want to buy a full on dac and amp now i just want to plug to my phone.. or maybe i could get a portable dac ? Or maybe I should return them üò≠ i think they won't accept the return

Southport, England ‚Äì iFi audio will be adding to its already extensive list of portable DAC audio products with the release of their Diablo X at CanJam NYC, February 25-26, 2023.¬† 

iFi have partnered with **xMEMS** as an official DAC/headphone amp technology partner.¬† The Diablo X is being released to support the brand-new xMEMS' ground-breaking solid state monolithic speaker technology.¬† 

The Diablo X, when paired with In-Ear Monitors featuring the xMEMS' monolithic micro speaker, will provide audiophile-level resolution, creating lightning-fast transient response, near-zero phase shift, and +/-1¬∞ part-to-part phase consistency, resulting in the most natural sounding In-Ear Monitors with the most accurate time domain music reproduction. The result is a highly uniform and reliable driver that eliminates the need to match and calibrate.¬† 

Just like the original iDSD Diablo, the Diablo X delivers reference level sound by using two BurrBrown DAC chips and a 16-core XMOS chip to process the data received via the USB and S/PDIF digital inputs, meaning the Diablo X can handle up to PCM 768, DSD 512, 2xDXD. It also provides full MQA decoding, like its predecessor.

audiophile,"I'm well aware the amount of trash people talk about these particular speakers. I got them as a gift from my dad and trying to make the best with what I got.

That being said, I was wondering on what receiver to go with for them? Ideally I'd like bluetooth with a radio option. As of now I have the Yamaha RX-V385, but that doesn't have a tape out option for the Bose equalizer. I was wondering if I run a different receiver with a tape out option, will the sound quality will be noticeably better? 

I will only be using these speakers for listening to music. The budget I have is around 5-600 for the receiver!"

audiophile,"I‚Äôm at a crossroads (not a Cream kind). I‚Äôve been into this hobby for about 10 years and my introduction to this world of audio, like many others, was thru vintage audio. At a younger age it was more approachable from a price point to create a full set up with vintage gear. Not to mention vintage gear possesses an aesthetic overall that modern gear just can‚Äôt touch. Gives me that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm exploring the cosmos with Kirk and Spock and we‚Äôre hanging in their listening room on the Enterprise‚Äù feeling (sonic quality still means the most to me by a long shot). Also, a lot of the older hifi folks like pushing the older is better narrative. Now sometimes that can be the case obviously. Dollar for dollar vintage gear probably has an advantage in the enjoyment and potential departments sonically but even that is hard to say definitively because with so many older parts there is so much that can go wrong. Obviously modern gear is the clear winner when is comes to resolution, sound stage, etc. as there has been much progress made in the last few decades technologically, but I‚Äôm of the thinking that more often than not at a fair price and with fully functionality, a say $3k vintage amp (resale price not original) can really give a $3k modern amp a run for its money and likely exceed it. I‚Äôm a budget minded audiophile so this was my logic for several years until I found that certain vintage pieces were interfering with my enjoyment of this hobby. Even professionally refurbished items require a lot more upkeep and servicing than most modern pieces I own. To be expected, surely, but I have grown tired of things going wrong and stalling my listening. I‚Äôve all but replaced my vintage gear at this point. The only old titan left standing is my Accuphase P-300 power amp. Now I love this guy. It meets sonic and aesthetic requirements for me. I‚Äôve had it fully refurbished and recapped. But i‚Äôve had to bring it in to be serviced twice in 5 years and maybe that‚Äôs not so bad for its age, I just worry that maybe I won‚Äôt have the option to bring it in somewhere close in my future (people retire from that line of work all the time because its so tedious). I have a certain amount of technological knowledge in this hobby and no time to take it to the next level unfortunately so major issues will always need to be resolved by another party. I‚Äôm bringing the amp in for some left channel woes on Friday and fingers crossed it‚Äôs an easy fix. That said, when I get it back I‚Äôve considered the possibility of selling it and using that money to fund the purchase of a pair of Schiit Tyr monoblocks. Effectively turning the page of my audio life to a new ‚Äúnew‚Äù chapter. It‚Äôs an emotionally charged decision, more than I was expecting. Is anyone else in the same boat? Does anyone have opinion that could help me move in one direction or another?"
audiophile,"Hi, I bought this JVC setup last week (¬£70) and I took it home, was enjoying the crap out of it, then bought the hifi stand (¬£40) &amp; decided to unplug the setup to clean up cables &amp; to be able to put each separate part in one shelf.

I have unplugged all the cables to try eliminate the issue by plugging in turntable only but still no sound.

audiophile,"This is not an audiophile question per se, but I‚Äôm hoping somebody can just give a recommendation.   I have a 11x12 room (9foot ceilings) that my rock jam band is mainly using for practice.   I‚Äôm about to pull the trigger on GIK bass traps in all corners. (Floor to ceiling) And also 24x48 panels on the walls and ceiling as well.  (I may use the room for HQ listening as well, but that‚Äôs not the priority).  Along a back plain wall, we will have a guitar amp in a corner, bass amp in another, and electronic drums (with a drum speaker) in between.   So they are all pointing across the room at another plain wall; I may put one or two panels  sideways, angled down along the ceiling/wall corner as well.

The vocals are coming out of Yamaha HS-5 monitors and a subwoofer, placed along that wall (so, vocals point back at all the instrument amps.

Each of the GIK products I‚Äôm about to buy, have 2 ‚Äòvariants‚Äô, and their consultant is recommending the ‚Äòrange limiter‚Äô version, which is described as follows:

‚ÄúOur proprietary Range Limiter membrane system allows the 244 Bass Trap panel to absorb up to 50% more low end (below 60Hz) and retains 75% more high end (from 400Hz and above) versus the broadband Full Range option.‚Äù

In other words, it will absorb even more bass, and allow more of the other frequencies to scatter around rather than get absorbed.     

Fwiw, when we jam, if I‚Äôm just playing guitar (at a ‚Äòfun‚Äô volume‚Äô) and singing, I can hear both really well.  Or if there is just guitar and drums it seems ok.  When all 4 are going (guitar, bass, drums, vocals) I can barely pick out vocals or my guitar‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a swirling mess of sound, as you‚Äôd imagined; we can hear bass reverberations, and I‚Äôm assuming the mid frequencies are also all competing with each other .  


Knowing only the above (I‚Äôm not gonna to SPL tests), should I get the range limiter versions of the bass traps and wall panels?   Or the full range. (Or some mix?).   it seems that we‚Äôre gonna be absorbing *plenty* of bass no matter what, with all these corner traps, and i want to absorb as much sound overall as possible?"

I try my best to review and compare it to other converters available today, to help you decide whether this one's the right one for you

audiophile,"One of my dads friends gifted me a pair of Ohm Model L speakers he's had since the 80's and they are really amazing. My family is trying to remodel the room they are in and we are looking for speakers that would match the audio quality of the Ohm's, but maybe a little smaller or lighter and/or possibly wireless (although I'm sure wireless might decrease the audio quality slightly). Any suggestions?"
audiophile,"I am wondering which is a better deal based on form factor, price and sound quality:

iPod touch 6 $50 + a amp probably around $100 or below
Fiio X5 iii $150I am open to suggestion as well, I narrowed down to the above due to price, small form factor and smart function.

Thanks!"

audiophile,"Hello, I am having some trouble setting up my sound system at home, I am going to list the products i have right now and that i am trying to connect but don't roast me please as i am slowly building it up haha

Turntable -  Sony PS-LX310BT 

Receiver - STR-DH790 

as for the speaker, then this is where it goes to shit but i am trying to use my Smasung soundbar for sound until i afford an upgrade on the speakers but i am having a lot of trouble setting them up due to lack of knowledge when it comes to audiophile stuff

audiophile,"Just a few days ago I purchased this record player as an upgrade from an LP60. Know it‚Äôs not a top of the line player, but it was from a local shop, I trust the guy who I bought it from, it‚Äôs a great store with good, well-informed people. Did my research and reviews all looked good. 

Generally pretty good at audio/tech stuff but man is this thing giving me trouble. Set up was easy, first few records sounded okay but noticed they were a little slow and distorted on some tracks. Rebalanced the tone arm, per AT setup video, still wonky. Tried to tune it up using the little adjustment screws on the bottom and still wonky. Weird thing is it would sound good for 15 min then it was all over the place for the next 5-10. Well now I‚Äôve made just about every little micro adjustment I can, and the thing is speeding up and slowing down mid play. Noticeable distortion but cartridge looks good, tone arm, tracking set as it should be, anti-skate as it should be. I‚Äôm completely at a loss. Have also been extremely careful with it and all components while adjusting. Any advice or something I may be missing? 

Note: downloaded RPM app which has a lot of good reviews and the RPMs are all over the place, which aligns with how records sound when played."
audiophile,"I‚Äôm really digging these Focal‚Äôs I just got, but after trying some of the amps we have around the house I‚Äôve gotten an increasing curiosity about amps. I‚Äôm looking to buy an amp for less than $1000, but I have some option. I enjoy my Carver amp, but I want something a little more modern (with some better integrated features). The amp is good, but sounds a little rolled off. Anyways I‚Äôm just trying to get a grasp of what amps would go well with them and honestly amps in general, like how many watts should I realistically be going for, class A stuff, all that jazz. I‚Äôm a little bit of a noob and am seeking discussion."

audiophile,"I have a pioneer sx 3700 that drives a pair of Linn keilidh. I like the setup but it‚Äôd like to feed a CD player and my TV into it. Plus, it‚Äôd be nice to have a remote for volume. 

I‚Äôve found some external DACs I like with remotes for about $500. That made me wonder if it wasn‚Äôt worth just getting the Marantz PM6007 or the Cambridge Audio CXA81 and not worrying about it any more. 

Any thoughts on how the marantz or the CA will compare to the pioneer? For reference the Linns need 60W per channel into 4 Ohms."

91k (ABR) and 48k (ASR). Also giving in consideration the codecs used, I heard that opus is slighly better than mp4a (I don't know if it's true), which source is the best choice?

The video source I chose is for the most part mp4 / avc1y, for some I chose webm / vp9, but for all of them I chose opus audio so far, I don't know if for these few I should change it to opus because of the codec and higher frequency (but lower bitrate)."

Klipsch something in the back for surround.

LOL, I kinda ""shadowboxed"" this TV and the speakers - when the lights are out, it's certainly black all around the TV. And yes - that's black truck bedliner on the walls.  
Dig the GMC TV. It's really surprising that the system sounds great, considering all that concrete. I do have the back wall treated to stop reflections, so that helps. I also think having the mains up so high helps prevent reflections off the floor and I do have a throw-rug down there now to also help.

audiophile,"I had a bad acoustic trauma during a week of live events (I work as a sound engineer).

From what I understand, I should be REALLY careful now, and I'm selling both my HS8 and HS5 by Yamaha to have a single pair of monitors.

I mainly produce and mix in my 4,5x4mt room, where I had the HS8, but now I'm looking at the Iloud MTM as a replacement, as I read they are very good at low listening levels, versus bigger monitors like the HS8 that need to move some air to get in the sweet spot.

&amp;#x200B;

Are the Iloud MTM a good substitute? My room is fully treated, but I'm questioning if I would be able to treat and manage bass frequencies correctly, given I will not listening at high volumes anymore.

Plus.. they are small and easy on the desk, not saying really easy to carry and move to other rooms.

I was looking at Neumann KH80 too, but seems that the bass is slightly lacking on those, without the expensive sub.

*Processing img o1ya0e1jqjja1...*

Hey Y'all. I had a few requests for a follow up post regarding the Cambridge CXN V2 streamer that I recently picked up. So, here's a quick review with a bonus compare/contrast with the Chromecast Audio &amp; DacMagic combo I was using. 

&amp;#x200B;

Test Equipment:

* Pioneer SA-9100 - fully recapped 
* Klipsch Forte IV &amp; Klipsch KG4's (upgraded) 
* Cambridge CXN V2
* Chromecast Audio
* DacMagic 100
* Furman power conditioner
* cables: yes, I used some. 

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the box: Sharp looking unit that everyone comments on. I bought this open box from Cambridge on eBay so it came in standard packaging. There was really nothing to tell that it wasn't standard Class A stock. Came with a quick start guide and coax RCA cable. I particularly like the big display which shows what's playing and the front panel buttons that allow you to play/pause. advance tracks, change settings and the like. Some have said the case seems flimsy but I don't think so, it seems fine to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Connecting it to my network was super simple. I used a Cat 8 ethernet cable and it immediately recognized the network and connected. There's an included wi-fi dongle and the setup is pretty straightforward and was done in about 2 minutes. (If you have a ethernet cable plugged in, the unti will default to wired connection.) The StreamMagic app is easy to use and intuitive. It's perhaps best for updating the settings of the unit. It has a launch section for opening your favorite streaming apps but the CXN showed up automatically on my Tidal, Spotify, and Amazon Music apps so I don't  really use that too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

The sound: In a word, excellent. The sound is open and airy with great sound stage. Instruments and voices are clearly separated and with live recordings, the room feel really starts to shine through. Some say the unit has a warm feeling but I don't see that, I think it's pretty neutral but that's just, like my opinion man. I ran it through it's paces with different styles and found it worked just as well with one vs the other. Cannonball Adderly's Somethin' Else sounds amazing with super clean horns and percussion but not sharp. at  all. Back Sabbath is powerful and punchy. Disintegration by The Cure is the wall of shinnery sound it should be. One Day More from the Les Mis Soundtrack can be a tough one because there's so much going on but every voice is clear and separated and not muddy at all.  THis has actually become one of my favorite ways to listen to musoc as of late and I'm an analog kind of guy typically. 

&amp;#x200B;

VS Chromecast - Let me preface by saying I love the Chromecast Audio. For the money, it's an excellent little device with a host of great features. That said, there's no comparison. While the Chromecast sounds nice, the Cambridge just out performs it on all metrics. (Not surprising though since it's 12x the cost) Music is clearer, more detailed, and just less clunky. I repurposed the Chromecast to my office and it's great for casual and background listening. For a sit down and geek out session though, the Cambridge is the hands down winner. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chromecast v Chromecast w/ DacMagic - Since I had the hood up, I thought I'd test this out. Surprisingly, there wasn't that huge if a difference between the straight Chromecast and the output run through the DacMagic. The sound was a bit richer and fuller (particularly the bottom end) through the DACMagic but not an astonishing difference. Again if this was just casual listening (cleaning house, making dinner, etc...) then there wouldn't be any need for the DAC. It did help a bit but was it $200 difference worth? Meh. Not 100% convinced. 

&amp;#x200B;

Digital input through Cambridge DAC - Now, here's where the difference happened! The Cambridge allows you to run digital input via TOSlink or Coax through it's onboard DAC as a separate input. I connected the Chromecast via TOSlink and ran Bohemian Rhapsody through the Cambridge DAC and the Cambridge did an amazing job of bumping up the sound quality of the Chromecast. While still not as good as the Cambridge itself, it started to get close NGL. Same result with my CD player. The sound run through the Cambridge was rich and full and compared to that, the onboard DAC's of the CD player just sounded thin and flat. While I don't listen to a ton of CD's, there was enough difference that I'm considering adding the CAmbridge CXC CD Transport to the stack. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, that's about it. I hope this helped someone at least.. haha. Feel free to ask any questions if you want."
audiophile,"System is still very much intact and even has some handmade stands for it.

Let me know what you think since I'm pretty much a noob in the Hi-Fi Audio field.

Thanks in advance :)"
audiophile,"I‚Äôve heard a few reviewers express the idea that some headphones sound better with more power (like from a good amplifier). Apparently, even if you‚Äôre getting a sufficiently high volume from your phone/computer, the headphone will still sound better with ‚Äúmore power.‚Äù This doesn‚Äôt make much sense to me, I don‚Äôt really see how you‚Äôd be delivering more power while the volume stays the same. But I don‚Äôt understand how headphones even work so I may be missing something. Is there anything to this idea? Any real scientific explanation?"

audiophile,"AVR: Sony-STR-DH790 ( I believe 145 Watt channels)
Speakers: Klipsch RP-280F (2)
Klipsch Quartet (2)
4 speakers total

So my friends and I are dumb college students with really nice speakers. Our old amp wasn‚Äôt cutting it so we just bought a Sony. Basically the story is we blasted all 4 speakers for a party for about an hour then we shorted the basement. We then repeated this cycle of hitting the circuit breaker and shorting the basement like 5 times until eventually all the power in the house went out. In the morning, we noticed something melted in the AVR from looking in the vents. We have tried to research why this is but couldn‚Äôt really figure it out. Are the speakers too powerful for the Amp or is it just stupid to play speakers full blast for that long. Obviously we were drawing absurd amounts of power but I thought a good AVR is supposed to regulate that type of stuff. Thanks for anything in advanced."
audiophile,I have a taramps 3k paired with 2 Sdr 12 on stock electrical that works perfectly other than the fact that when i turn my ignition all the way on (starting my truck) my started draws so much current it cause my amp to go into protection and i have to restart my truck to get it to turn on ( sometimes that doesn‚Äôt even work first try )
audiophile,"So I have lately been thinking a lot about tuning, targets and upgrading to the V2 Arya. Once the frequency target has been achieved through EQ, and/or pad swapping, what is left that influences sound...?

A lot of people feel that most other things like imaging, micro dynamics, speed and all that is all marketing jumbo once you have a good headphone (like an HD600).

There is also the question of timbre. I know what it technically means but how on earth (if at all) does it exist in headphones? I'm looking for a different 'texture' and experience in reaching for a good Planar so I want to know if this is real or just psychological. 

My question: I'm looking at buying the Arya because it has an extended frequency range and uses a different technology, it's well made and comfortable. If I got them and tuned both to the Harmon curve (for example) will I hear a notable difference?"
audiophile,"So I just spent a ton of money and upgraded my speakers. I got two goldenear triton 2+ for front speakers, goldenear supercenter reference, and supersat 30s for surrounds. I also have 2 anvisa 650 on ceiling for atmos. I have a pioneer vsx-lx102 receiver - which I got many years ago. I don‚Äôt need very high volumes as my room is small. What do I get with a better receiver? Will my speaker sound night and day different with a emotiva or anthem receiver or just a very marginal improvement?"
audiophile,Hey everyone just wondering if this is a over kill match for a mild system or if the sub will possibly over power the speakers TIA
audiophile,"I don't have issues with my audio quality exactly, but it's like I'm expecting more. I use Galaxy buds 2 pro on the daily, but at home I have Schiit Hel2e amp + Philips X2HR. And for awhile it was an amazing experience, but now I feel like I'm expecting more out of a fairly expensive setup (in my opinion, ik there's much better setups)
But is there something you need to do on desktops for a good audio quality experience? I'm not running any audio drivers, just type C to Type C.

Does it when the sub is powered on but the intergraded amp (klipsch pwergate) doesn‚Äôt need to be powered to get the CB through the sub. 

My neighbor has a giant antenna in is yard so I guess that‚Äôs the culprit. Is there a way to isolate my system from that interference?

audiophile,"By parallel I mean there‚Äôs one system for pure analog and another for home theater. 

I picked up these Barzilay cabinets with EV TRX 12 triaxial drivers for dirt cheap. I was skeptical at first, but now just amazed by how musically satisfying they can be. The amps are Pass Labs Amp Camp Class A blocks, running at 15w into 16 ohm. I can turn the Aragon 24k SP‚Äôs silky volume knob almost all the way up to where it‚Äôs almost too loud with nearly zero distortion. (Well, there is some, but hey it‚Äôs Class A so it‚Äôs the ‚Äúgood‚Äù kind of distortion.) 

The Marantz TT S1 has a Sumiko Amethyst driven by a MoFi Studio. 

And that power conditioner isn‚Äôt just for show. My house has very poor wiring with a lot of voltage drops and EMF.

I have a small collection of records around 50 but I plan to actively grow it. I mainly listen to post-rock and post-metal on this setup if that matters :)"
audiophile,"I've had a Studio 24C driving some 250 Ohm Baerdynamic 770 pros for some time now, but never thought about this question until today for some reason. Does the volume of the 24c affect the ""quality"" of the audio I'm getting? In other words, would it be optimal to put the 24c audio and desktop audio at max, and adjust spotify and video game audio as needed? Or the other way around? Or does it matter at all?"
audiophile,"Growing up, my dad had a pair of the legendary AR-3s by Acoustic Research. They sounded fantastic at the time, and what I remembered most vividly was how incredibly tight the bass response was. My memory may be failing me, but I think they would hold up even by today's standards. However, this precision was achieved by design. No ports of any kind. A sealed enclosure design we know as [acoustic suspension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_suspension). I get that the downside is the incredible power required to drive speakers of this design. Back in the day, he used a pair of Dyna 70 tube amps in their mono-block configuration. 

I'm guessing the brilliant minds of this sub who are experts in speaker design can enlighten me as to why this speaker design fell into disfavor by speaker manufacturers. I know there are a few brands out there that still offer some, but I haven't heard many references to them here."
audiophile,"My Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 just died and I would like to upgrade to something a little nicer. 

I currently have an RME ADI-2 DAC that is connected into my PC (for headphone use). Since I have this DAC I am looking to get some computer desk (nearfield) speakers to plug into it. 

I like a warmer sound. I listen to Spotify (rap &amp; EDM music), and YouTube videos. So the production quality of the sounds isn't the greatest. I want something that won't cause listening fatigue. 

I'm afraid of getting too good of speakers and hearing all the noise/distortion from poor-quality sources and making it unenjoyable to listen to. I'm already experiencing this with my Beyerdynamics DT1990 Pro's listening to low-quality sources.  

What speakers would you recommend I get? Budget under $1,500. I was thinking about getting a pair of Genelec 8030C's but I'm afraid they will not sound good on the lower-quality sources I listen to."
audiophile,"I‚Äôm talking about the normal gen 2 AirPods, not the pros. 

I pulled them out of the box and they had the original firmware. They sounded AMAZING.

Did the most recent update and it destroyed the quality. Did an analysis and see that the audio is now more V shaped. Much thinner. 

I saw other YouTube videos where this has been confirmed as well.

DO NOT UPGRADE UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE SIGNIFICANT AUDIO QUALITY.

audiophile,"So as some of you may recall, I‚Äôve been digging through my grandfathers old shop to clean it out and move things over to my shop. This is something else that I‚Äôve found - a General Electric audio oscillator. I‚Äôve tried looking it up, and I found [this pdf](https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Site-Early-Radio/Archive-Radio-News-IDX/IDX/40s/48/Radio-News-1948-09-R-OCR-Page-0011.pdf) which lists the publish date in 1948. My grandfather was an engineer in the Army for WW2, not sure if this could possibly be *that* old. 

Is it still useful? Does it have any value or is it just cool to look at? Any information is greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
audiophile,"I know there are posts regarding KRK feedback, but I can't find one related to this specifically, so hopefully this is accepted.

I recently purchased KRK Classic 5 monitors. I initially used a M-Audio Duo interface with 1/4 inch patch cables out to the monitors. Noticed some hissing and popping, but it was extremely prevalent (and exponentially pronounced) when playing video games. Not so much when I watch YouTube or anything, but definitely in graphic-intensive gaming.

I swapped the M-Audio for a Scarlett 2i2. Sounds essentially the same. Tried different USB ports, unplugging various devices, etc. trying to track it down.

I then ran a UserBenchmark test, and when it got to the GPU portion the feedback was MASSIVE. So, to me, obvious interference when I do anything that is GPU intensive (I have a MSI Gaming X Trio 4090 GPU).

So, now what? I'm obviously not going to swap out a 4090 GPU in this situation. The interface can't really get much further from the PC due to the USB connection. I'm kind of stuck as to how to overcome this."

audiophile,"I've had two sets of tannoy speakers for a while and very stupidly lent them to a friend for a party. She managed to break one speaker from each set, the light speaker shown is slightly quieter now than its counterpart. and the black speaker has a really crackled noise to it. I really love these speakers and would like to try to repair them myself but am struggling to find out how to start. I've seen videos online showing how to cut into the speaker and change the fitting surrounding them but I do not want to immediately do that in case I mess it up myself or find that's not the actual problem. If anyone can help me determine what exactly is wrong with them that would be a great help. Googling seems to just confuse as so many methods are spoken about"
audiophile,"So the sad day finally came, when my speakers started to sound like crap (yay to weird sounds!). About 20 years ago we replaced the subwoofers (they are 12"").  Well when we went to see what was wrong with them and removed the grill, needless to say the speakers themselves were deteriorated.  I'm pretty sure the floorstanding speakers are Infinity References from the late 70s to early 80s (somewhere thereabouts).  Sadly, they do not make replacement parts for them anymore (called, checked boo hoo). 

I had them running through a Phase Linear 400 amp and a Marantz 3800 preamp (so no, not a powered sub!).

Does anyone know where to buy parts (both the foam as well as the entire speaker if necessary) for these old speaker types that could be a good replacement? Or somewhere that could tell me exactly what to buy?!"
audiophile,"Im new to any kind of pro audio an im having an issue with my setup. I currently have my PC going to my Crown xli800 amp with RCA cables and that is then powering my Paradigm speakers. 

Issue im having is when browsing the web and moving the mouse i get a buzzing noise. And when gaming it can get bad, guess its GPU interferance or something. 

From my own reading it seems i need a DAC with its own power supply and i came up with the Schiit Modi multibit 2 or the Modi 3+. Just wanna know what you guys think before i buy something an need to return it because it does not work

Thanks."
audiophile,"I‚Äôve traveled remoteless for most of my hifi journey.  I got into the hobby during Covid by learning to solder and restoring some vintage Marantz and Sansui gear. That led to Bottlehead and ACA kits. All remote-free. Recently picked up a Rogue RP-1 tube preamp given its reputation of pairing well with the First Watt J2 and for its stellar phono stage. The fairly basic remote was an afterthought for my purchase, after all, I‚Äôve made this far without one. 

Volume, source, balance, mute, but no power button.

Oh how do I love thee, Rogue remote, let me count the ways. Ok, actually it‚Äôs just volume and balance control that has me smitten. And power would be nice. But still!

On big concerts or festivals the systems are pretty powerful, but not very mobile. Is there sweetspot between Mobileness and power?

I would like to ask the community to please suggest some systems."
audiophile,"Hey all,   

I had been doing some lurking and reading reviews of others and checking out various DAC products and newer soundcards. I had seen others mention that Fosi Audio had a beta program so I applied and sure enough they responded.   

So I do want to make it clear that I received this product for free in exchange for writing a review. No catch other than that.   

I've been interested in trying a DAC/AMP solution for many years after hearing how many people use them and swear by them, especially in the gaming community.   

I've been using my Creative X-Fi Fatal1ty Professional PCIe sound card for over 10 years. It uses this chipset (Cirrus Logic CS4832) from what I've looked up and it still is working for me in Windows 10. I‚Äôm not positive on the chipset within the Fosi.   

I had no complaints with the sound card, but I'd always heard such good things about DAC/AMP combos that I wanted to try one out and see if it really did sound better.   

My review of the product itself: is the feel of the buttons are high quality and the aluminum case is high quality. I really like the feel of turning the knobs as it‚Äôs smooth. I do feel that the knobs are too close together and given that I have large fingers, it makes it difficult to turn them if you're really adjusting them without running into the other buttons/knobs. The manual was straightforward and the accessories, packaging were all quality feeling and protective.   

So it was a very simple setup. One thing that struck me or surprised me was the manual mentions to always turn the volume knob down to low when turning on.  I‚Äôm assuming this is so you don‚Äôt blow your speakers if there‚Äôs loud music playing in the background. I didn‚Äôt have any issues with this in terms of turning my computer on or off.   

It connects with USB-C to either USB-C or USB-C with an adapter plug connected to USB-A, but I also had to go into my bios to ensure that my ports didn't shut off if I put my computer to sleep or shut down. This was on my Asus Strix Z590-E motherboard.   

I'm not sure if this could cause issues for other people or how strict the power requirements really are.   

I did have some instances where my default device kept changing away from the DAC solution, but changing the BIOS things seem to have helped lessen that.   

One thing I wasn't sure about was recommendations online that I saw about keeping the Windows volume at 100% and then adjusting the volume knobs to control your volume versus using the Windows built-in volume control. There's no guidance for this in the manual so it wasn't sure on that and that but that is how I tested it.   

I do feel the LED light is a bit too bright especially at night and I have noticed it flicker here and there. Sometimes. I wish there was a way to turn it off or that it had a softer glow.   

As far as sound quality, I don‚Äôt consider myself an audiophile. I feel it's actually really good and I understand why many people that have onboard sound would recommend getting something like this. Everything sounds very‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúCrisp‚Äù and ‚Äúclean.‚Äù  No extra noise, hiss, etc.  The bass seemed solid to me and I also upped the treble by about a ‚Öì of a turn. However, I don't know if the sound is much better than my sound card. I feel they're very similar, but I do enjoy the features of the sound blaster/ creative card because of the enhancements, especially when it comes to gaming and the Crystalizer and SVM.  I believe the Crystalizer also gives the edge to the Creative card over the Fosi when it comes to music.     

Overall, I think it's a solid product at an affordable price compared to the competition. I can also see where it could be useful for certain individuals. If you have bad quality onboard sound due to chipset or an experienced noisy front panel audio (typically bad shielding) this would definitely solve that problem. It should also allow you to maximize the potential of most quality headphones under $300.   

I was testing with:
Custom built PC
Asus Strix Z590-E
Sennheiser HD558 Headphones 3.5mm jack
Fosi Audio K5 Pro plugged in via included USB-C - USB-C cable
Windows Volume 100%
Windows Audio Settings  24 bit 96kHz (192 kHz is limited to Optical)

If anyone wants some pictures of the unit happy to share."
audiophile,"Let me start off by saying that I've never enjoyed playing music loud and I've recently moved countries (so kid of a new setup and room). I've been living in this place for about 10 months, and have owned my current system since then, which is: dynadui special forty + primare i35 prisma. Sources are digital (tidal and local Flac) and use roon as a player.

I don't have a treated room, the best I could do is add curtains, but no drilling can be done.

The thing is, I get fatigue quite early if listening for about over 1 hour, and I'm wondering what I could try to modify to alleviate it. I guess room treatment is the first thing that comes to mind. I've just bought a mini dsp umik 1 to do a digital room correction that's described in roon forum. An initial attempt at this (didn't do it properly) resulted in a lot of cuts and boosts in the eq to compensate the response curve, so I assume the room acoustics are indeed quite bad.

Anything else in the components that could also contribute? Maybe the dynaudio being too analytical or whatever? Open to suggestions"

I'm working on a raspberry pi project where I have a microphone and speaker soldered to a sound card adapter/USB connected to the Raspberry Pi. The speakers work great, but the microphone on the raspberry pi gives a buzzing noise (possibly a ground loop?) when I record. It's possible it's picking up interference from the nearby solder joints on the PCB, but I've spread them apart as best I can. I also tried unsoldering the speakers and I hear the same buzzing sound in the background of the recording. Do you all know of an equalizer of some sort that runs on Linux, where I can fix the audio input from the Microphone?  


Could it be just a really cheap microphone which needs to be replaced?

audiophile,"Big fan of Apple music but the best I can get into a hi-fi system (NAD M17) is CD quality (44-48K). Anyone figure this out? Here is what I have tried:

1. Apple 4K - latest and greatest - downscales audio to 48K! It cannot do lossless which is bewildering (which means that Tidal on Apple TV is also useless) considering it is 4K and I have the latest 8K HDMI cables on it. It is a limit of the software?
2. Streaming from a MAC Studio to the M17 (Airplay) will not go beyond 48K! (So illogical!) The music app on Studio does not stream lossless (so what is the point?)
3. From an iPAD (latest Pro), same thing - drops to 48K! (When I select NAD M17 for output)
4. I tried an optical coax from the studio to the NAD - same, 48K.

I ensured I was playing the ""apple master"" lossless version (I use Hotel California).

But with Tidal:

1. BluOS I can stream in 88K with their masters content to the NAD. 88K no problem.
2. From the Tidal app on the Mac studio  - I can select M17 and it streams at 88K
3. On the iPad - same - Tidal app streams just fine in 88K to the NAD

So I am really confused .. what is the point of apple music lossless if it cannot be transported anywhere?"

audiophile,"Hi,

Previously in the [dynamics of music](https://magicvinyldigital.net/2023/01/05/dynamics-of-the-media-and-music/), we saw the difference between the dynamics of the medium and the dynamics of the music, as well as [the effects of dynamic compression on the music in terms of distortion](https://magicvinyldigital.net/2023/01/07/loudness-war-the-limit-of-the-0db-in-digital-or-analog-better-than-digital/).

Today, we will discuss another aspect, the impact of dynamics on tape or vinyl recording.

The subject seems simple, we transfer the digital file to tape or vinyl and it is reproduced with little or no modifications.

To do this, we will use a test master file that includes the same musical sample with a different DR ranging from DR19 to DR7 as shown in the graph below :

https://preview.redd.it/xm9vli12k5ja1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d7b19089948ce47bce6e48a787d8d772e17c06dd

This master file is burned on vinyl and played on a turntable. We then obtain the following result:

https://preview.redd.it/fvlqp1p3k5ja1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=304839e65a5091f6ae7bd518d37cb2e3138ca29a

We notice that the variation is only from DR17 to DR10. In particular for the low DR, we notice that we do not go below the DR10.

To better represent this phenomenon, here is a synthesis curve which presents on the horizontal axis the DR value of the master from DR7 to DR19, and on the vertical axis the DR result after the playback of the vinyl cut with this master:

https://preview.redd.it/ljvasey5k5ja1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7ed7d0bb2624dd6d36160c51eb3bda85a31f6d98

We can see that the vinyl does not go below DR10 in this example. This increase is therefore a distortion generated during the cutting and playback process compared to the original master.

Why this result? Vinyl is analog and it uses electromagnetic and mechanical means that give it a specific functioning. This operation is not compatible with certain digital treatments like the use of the Brickwall limiter which strongly distorts the signal in the digital world.

To go further in this test, the same operation is carried out with a magnetic tape on which we record the reference master. On playback, we obtain the same phenomenon as shown by the synthesis curve grouping the vinyl and the tape:

https://preview.redd.it/b6u8tfl8k5ja1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=550702481d92e8358980219cd3905bb8f3be560b

What can we conclude :

* Analog media have their own characteristics that must be respected to obtain a faithful reproduction on these media. Therefore, a specific master is needed for these media.
* The use of brickwall limiters generates distortion, and if you burn a vinyl or record a tape from this type of digital master, you generate distortion again. It's a double punishment by accumulating distortion twice. So it's anything but high fidelity.
* Measuring the DR on analog media is possible, but it does not always allow you to deduce the DR of the master that was originally used.

Find the whole test with more details on its realization and the measurements [here](https://magicvinyldigital.net/2023/02/19/do-analog-media-force-a-dynamic-on-music-or-does-analog-media-increase-the-dynamics/).

audiophile,"The following is a work of satire. Or is it?

This may be true for about 50% of the Boomers:

* They think their ears are the reference to measure speakers, but usually frequency response drops after you are reached 4 or 5 years. At close to 50 i can't hear anything above 14kHz and that is with good ears. It drops sharply, at 60 you can't hear 12kHz and so on.
* Their knowledge is from 80ies Hifi magazines. It's 2023, read a book by Toole and learn something new, for petes sake.
* Their deep pockets let manufacturers think they should take $10k for something that should be priced $3k.
* They alone are the root of audiophile power/speaker/USB/HDMI and network cables. They caused the proliferation of audiophile network switches and cable risers.

Not saying it's all the Boomers, but it's almost all of them in my experience. I can't even have a serious discussion about technicals with them, as they immediately fall back to ""my ears are the reference"" in one form or another.

Don't upvote if you don't agree or are over 60. :-p"
audiophile,Out of curiosity I just changed the input of the speakers black into red and red into black. For some reason I have the feeling it sound better (rooms acoustic is less noticeable). Is this possible or just in my head?
audiophile,"I didn't want to leave this in a comment, because i thought it's an interesting topic asked by u/IlPulcini elsewhere. He asked how to detect if a speaker is versatile or universal.

Here was my answer, maybe you have something to add or a different opinion:

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few things that make speakers versatile and maybe even universal, in no particular order:

1. Directivity, you want your speakers emit sound in the same SPL (sound pressure level), no matter where you place the microphone. If that is the case, you can use EQ (equalization), for example with DSP (digital signal processing) to fix flaws in the loudness of particular frequencies. Example, if your speaker is that loud at 4kHz and 6kHz, but less at 5kHz, and there is no problem with directivity, you can just boost 5kHz and the speaker will sound a lot better. In short, look for flat on axis and off axis frequency response.
2. Distortion, you want a speaker that has as low a distortion as possible. As i said. Distortion rises with SPL, so starting with a lower distortion is very useful for EQ correcting your speakers, without ending up with audible distortion.
3. Frequency response, you want it as flat as possible so you don't have to use EQ to fix it in the first place.
4. Frequency range, you want your speakers play as much as possible of the frequencies humans can hear, that is at least 20kHz at the upper limit and as low as possible in the lower. Again, EQ can help a bit, but sometimes you just need larger speakers or subwoofers because of physics.
5. Max SPL, you want them to be able to play loud without overwhelming distortion.

No speaker will be perfect in all those points, but let me drop a few manufacturers names that strive for those ideals:

* KH
* Genelec
* Neumann

$4k gets you a pair of Neumann KH150, which gets you very far with the things i mentioned above.


Also important, ignore speakers without good measurements and don't ever trust your ears or people that tell you to trust your ears, or some audiophiles will make you an audiophool and take advantage of you.

And now let the downvotes flow!"

audiophile,"Hello, 

I recently bought a q-acoustics 3020i (for $449) and an used KEF q150 (for $269) . I paired them with a Bluemound power node and they are both amazing. I didn't do anything scientific, I simply sit at my desk and played the various genre I like and a few songs in Spotify audiophile play list.

I find that the 3020i has smaller sound sounds stage and struggle in bass but it really sings with warmth. Also it is so much smaller and better looking than KEF. I want to like 3020i, I want it to beat KEF but I think KEF is superior overall. Btw, the KEF is a used speaker so it might have already been broken in. 

My question is would adding a subwoofer (planning to add SVS 3000 micro) to the 3020i help me? Lastly, would it only be fair to broken in on 3020i before I make the comparison?  My main use is music and some RPG gaming.

audiophile,"So‚Ä¶ a client wants to not hear the highway when they‚Äôre in their backyard.

My boss heard about how noise cancelling headphones play ‚Äúopposite‚Äù sounds that cancel out actual sounds. And went on to suggest that we would be looking into sound systems that could do that for the client‚Äôs backyard.

I later overheard him talking to someone on the phone about generating these opposite sounds based off an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù sample of typical highway noise.

This, to me, all seems immediately and obviously at odds with‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ physical reality. Headphones work because they‚Äôre tethered to your ears - the distance, and therefore latency, is predictable and constant, so running a wave out of phase is predictable and constant. If you have speakers surrounding you, your distance to each as you move about is constantly changing. Your noise canceling signal would be subject to doppler, if not simply at the wrong phase unless you‚Äôre in a perfect sweet spot. And if you‚Äôre just cancelling pre-recorded ‚Äúhighway brand‚Äù white noise, it seems like you‚Äôd end up getting even more distracting noises coming from the highway as they bleed through an otherwise quiet yard.

Am I just being a shortsighted asshole to think this can‚Äôt be done?"

audiophile,"I have been searching for a new amp for a little over a year and a half. I had a Rotel RB1070 that I had found basically NOS for a song. The amp sounded good and and did its job well. I had wanted to step up to something new vs. recapping the amp. I had almost pulled the trigger a couple of times on a Parasound A21, but didn't I kept hearing about newer class D besting a lot of other older AB amps. I found a good deal on a Class-D Audio 4070 and tried that. It sounded flat and boring and had noticeably less stage and absolutely no depth from my 1070. I finally decided to just go for a Purifi. I shopped around for a long time and settled on the Buckeye after not finding the M23 deal I was looking for (yup I am cheap and didn't want to pay the current market value for a used M23. I have been listening to it all day and from the first song, it wasn't yeah it does sound a bit better, it was wow, every bit of the stage of my 1070 but cleaner, more coherent, and of course absolutely silent and cool running with absolutely no noise floor that I can hear.   I love how good this amp sounds for the $1200.   
Naysayers don't even bother with the amps don't have a sound, they only amplify the signal. Every amp I have had in my system has a different sound signature. I am not wanting the debate. Just really happy with the purchase.

audiophile,"Hey everyone, new to this subreddit. So I'm having technical issues with my Apollo Twin USB. Whenever I switch to channel 2, it works fine. However, as soon as I turn on the 48V phantom power, the preamp immediately hits the red and stays stuck there until I turn it off. After a random amount of time, the right side where the speaker levels are shown it spikes and stays at red

 I've tried factory resetting it twice but the same issue still applies. Strangely Channel 1 works fine and has no issues at the moment. What's even stranger is if I keep turning it on and off, it'll fix itself till it feels like it wants to break again.

audiophile," 

Hello everyone, I just want to start this off by saying I know little to nothing when it comes to anything audio equipment / Hi-Fi so bare with me, I was able to come across a pair of ( JBL Synthesis L100 Classic's ) extremely cheap. There is nothing wrong with them and I think they sound amazing, However like I said I know basically nothing when it comes to good amplifiers or the best way to use these speakers. I bought a SMSL AO200 ( [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097DN8R6W?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_product\_details](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097DN8R6W?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) ) to drive the speakers ( I basically only wanted something BT and really don't even use them much) But I also came across a Denon AVR-2113CI, By just looking at price alone the Denon is similarly priced to the AMP I bought when it's used (Much higher new) , I'm basically just looking for suggestions if I should switch to the Denon or keep running the AMP I bought and sell the Denon. I have a Victrola Record player that I don't use to play Vinyl's but plan on getting a higher quality one to actually play some of the records that I have but that's down the road"
audiophile,"Just that. And to begin with, I have to apologize for misusing the term ""top end"". It's actually more like a medium level unit that just happens to have exceptionally good sound for its 400 or 500 dollar price range; it punches way over its weight, and sounds much better than its price point. But all that crap doesn't fit into a post title.   

I have a really nice room  system, with floor speakers and vintage twin 500-watt amps, and it includes an SACD Oppo disc player that I really love a lot. For various reasons, I need to move away more and more from the room system, and switch to headphones. For various *additional* reasons, I'm not going to be able to use the existing pre-amp or amps for the headphones; I have to get a different stand-alone amp now just for the disc player. 

I would also like to include a TV in the new setup, and *that* is going to need both an amp *and* a DAC. I won't be using the  TV very much, so I don't want to spend much more than $100-150 for the DAC/amp, and I was thinking of using the same DAC/amp for both the disc player and the TV. 

So the question is, if I buy a DAC/amp in that price range, and run the disc player through it, will the really good audio quality from the Oppo be degraded by the DAC in the fairly low-priced amp? Do I need to get a more expensive amp just to get the sound quality I'm used to from the Oppo? I really hate to spend too much money amping the TV, because of the 3 devices I'll be using, the TV will be maybe 15% of the usage. Not worth spending more than 100 bucks or so for that.

Or, what *is* the best solution to all this?

Thanks in advance."

audiophile,"Having owned both moderate sized Martin Logan and Magnepan speakers in the past I am very used to their dipole configuration and how it presents the soundstage in my listening room. I was invited to participate in the Magnepan Focus Group session at Audio Excellence in Markham Ontario (Toronto). I found on the first sample Japanese drum recording that there was visceral pressure being registered in my throat while high frequency attack was striking to the point of grabbing my attention when presented those notes. The second drum set track recording had more impact in the lower bass region from the kick drums and I could feel the pressure in my sternum. The soundstage panned right to left with presence and depth in the recording. There was full range sound in both recordings presented by the drum skins and initial bite from the drum strikes, impressive for a woofer system only. Cymbals were also present in the second recording, Wendell lowered to volume to save our hearing.

Afterwards the addition of the Martin Logan Electrostatic panels with the UBS woofers with a 500hz approximate crossover point showed a very seamless presentation with no audible artifacts. I can't comment on anything negative at the moment, I would need more time with recordings I know well.  


Very interesting presentation from Wendell and Galina.

audiophile,"I'm in an annoying conundrum. I love my set up for listening to music, I have everything I need BUT the tinkerer in me is wanting to try some eq profiles and experiment with weird DSP stuff. 

Sonically my set up sounds great, I guess I just want to know how far I can push things sonically. 

My devices can't be jailbroken so all those useful apps can't be used. If there is a hardware solution I'd be very interested in that."
audiophile,"So I am using a Behringer eurolive f1220d floor monitor coupled with a Mackie profx10v3 mixer and it all sounds great.

I am however curious if it is normal to hear white noise (not playing any music) when maxing out the speaker volume, and all the volume levels on the mixer + the input.

The signal to noise ratio is (very) good but I am curious wether this aspect that I've just mentioned is natural. Oh and by the way, I am using only balanced, stereo, mid-to-high quality cables.

Thanks!"

audiophile,"Hi audiophiles! I'm a **newbie** and I'm looking around through posts, websites and guides about hifi setups and brands and I'm facing some questions right now in my head: *|Is hifi wort for rap music? |are there some brands that make products specifically for hiphop, rap, trap, drill listeners?*   


99% of the hi-fi adviced online is used and reviewed by listeners who focus on rock, classical music, jazz or edm, so I never know if product advices are reletable to me, starting from speakers and headphones and ending with dacs and amplifiers (*|are dacamps a real thing or just a ""fast"" solution that is crap?*)

&amp;#x200B;

Also we all know that rap music was born in the street, played in boomboxes and portable speakers or in clubs and sometimes also modern producers reveals that they mix on some shitty speakers to make the sound perform for the more casual speaker (car stereo, crappy pc speakers or stock earbuds)  
*|So is the Hi-Fi world really worth for a* ***only rap*** *listener?*  


I usually listen to rap music and what I'd like to appreciate is a clear sound that make me **listen what the producer intended to** (no boosts or ""forced sound signature"") in a genre full of *bass, hi hats, ad-libs, skits, samples from different genres*), should I look up to Studio Monitor Speakers and Headphones or it's another thing?  


Thanks in advance for all the advices. Here some of the artists i like and listen 99% of the time:

audiophile,"I just downloaded an album from Bandcamp in FLAC format where, for some reason, a couple of the tracks have a higher bit depth (24) than the others (16). Normally, I put all the songs from an album into their own folder and use the command line tool `metaflac` in Linux to add track and album replaygain: `metaflac --add-replay-gain *.flac`. But `metaflac` throws an error if the songs in an album have different bit depths, as documented in the [man pages here](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/flac/metaflac.1.en.html).

Are there any replaygain tools that can add replaygain to an album with different bit depths on each track?

Note: Here ""bit depth"" means the number of bits *per sample,* not the more commonly used *bit rate* (usually ~1000 KB / s) which is the bit depth (usually 16 or 24 bits) times the sample rate (usually 44.1 or 48 kHz)."

I used the knockoff until my Schiit stack came. I remember it sounding way more refined in the higher-mid range, but im not 100% sure cause i only used the knock off for 10 days, and the schiit stack for like 2 months. The switches broke on the back of the magni, so i switched back to the knockoff. Its been doing the job, but I finally can afford to by the replacement switch and sodder it on, but HERE IS WHERE THE QUESTION STARTS: i also have enough that i could upgrade to the schiit magni 3/heresy. Should i just stick with my newly fixed 2, or spend the 300 on the updated newer schiit stack?

this song is available in stereo version in 16 bits 44.1 kHz and Dolby Atmos.

The comparison of the waveforms below between the stereo version and the Dolby Atmos Binaural version shows the effect of the compression of the dynamics on the stereo version with the suppression of certain peaks.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8bxuytkcqwia1.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=36b35aec98ae9a61d0a28127829593f5f86faba0

This is confirmed by the dynamic range measurement, DR12 for the binaural version and DR5 for the stereo version. It is a pity that the stereo version is limited in dynamics for this style of music.

When listening, the stereo version lacks precision and details in the zones impacted by the limiter. The binaural Atmos version offers a better rendering of voices and more openness.

It is the Atmos version decoded in 7.1.4 which brings an opening of the sound scene to 180 degrees and a beautiful presence of the voice as shown in the breakdown below:

The downmix of the Atmos version in stereo also gives a very good rendering, better than stereo release.

audiophile,I'm going to be in Atlanta for a week next month and I was wondering if there are any HIFI stores that I can go audition some decent speakers. Not crazy expensive but let's say Klipsch Heritage and above.
audiophile,"the implimentation is so good, it really beats anything. Apple really cares about audio. For example, their bluetooth implementation of aac codec beats androids. ive always known flac was a garbage format. The way it handles metadata is just bad. 

digital playback is not always the same. Spdif over a coax cable sounds better than Optical. because jitter is a thing.

By the way I listen to all my music at 44.1 kilohertz 16 bit because anything higher is pointless."
audiophile,"I saw these speakers during a Jungle set at The Lab London and thought they‚Äôre one of the prettiest speakers I think I‚Äôve seen.

Which begs the question: what are some of the most aesthetically pleasing speakers you guys have seen?"
audiophile,"To be connected to a  [Denon - AVR-X3700H 8K](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/denon-avr-x3700h-8k-ultra-hd-9-2-channel-105-watt-x-9-av-receiver-2020-model-3d-audio-video-built-for-gaming-black/6421384.p?skuId=6421384)  with 105w x 9, 2 Klipsch RP-8060FAs, a

audiophile,"Ive been trying my KEF LS50 wireless ii for a while. But never quite really satisfied with it.

Since its my first higher end system, I am really lost on how to EQ it using the Kef Connect app.

So I plugged on my TV with toslink out to the KEfs, played something cool (like those +100k dollar systems) and then I keep alterning from YouTube to Tidal Connect, trying to copy the YouTube ‚Äúsound profile‚Äù.

Thats the EQ that got closest to YouTube:
- desk mode: -8,5dB (adjusts presence region: 170Hz +/- 1 octave)
- wall mode: -4,5dB (adjusts all frequencies bellow 500Hz
- trebble trim: -2,5dB (adjusts frequencies aboce 500Hz)
- bass extension: extra (lowest rollof point: 50Hz)

(Large room, irregular, speakers very close to rear walls and close to side walls, lively room, no rugs and no treatment whatsoever)

Am I doing something stupid? I hope YouTube doesnt take low-mid frequencies caus with desk mode above -3dB things sounds really fuller - but loses overall definition and clarity)

Sounds good actually, but sometimes I dread Im losing low-mids while being misguided by high end systems on Youtube.

Would be great to hear some opinions on this. Maybe you try it yourself? Sounds like it worked for me after all."
audiophile,I know many people have opinions about speaker wire but was wondering people‚Äôs experience with lifespan- I don‚Äôt have any issues with my wires and I take good care of them (I trim the corrosion and use gold plated terminals on the posts) but it seems like that would be my next area to upgrade. Can speaker wire theoretically last for decades if taken care of?
audiophile,I have a stereo receiver that has a wired input for FM. I‚Äôve been using a speaker wire but I want to get an actual antenna. Is there any cheap ones out there I can buy that will work?
audiophile,"Hello, I was just browsing Cambridge audio page. Right now, I have two pairs of SX-50s, loved them but I wanted to check some details. I run into this article about burn in, their explanations is quite clear but I wanted to know if you have comments regarding the article. My experience with burn is quite weird, so I wanted to know a more technical explanation.

audiophile," 

My AVR is a Marantz SR 5015 and my LCR speakers are 6 ohms, the surrounds are 8 ohms. My AVR in the manual says to change the ohm selector to 6 ohms if any of the speakers are 6 ohms or to 4 ohms if any of the speakers are 4 ohms. My question is the following: I'm thinking of buying Sonus Faber Lumina 2 because I also listen to stereo music but these speakers are 4 ohms rated and I really don't know what to do because it will be R-L 4 ohms C 6 ohms S 8ohms."
audiophile,"Why don't I see this brand talked about more? It's the first brand to entirely blow me away by the sound quality, I found it because I stealthily inspected someone's soundbar for the brand after hearing it. I had to go out and pick myself up one of their portable speakers, even with the sizeable downgrade this is still one of the best quality speakers I've experienced."
audiophile,"To start, I am not really an audiophile, I would just like some advice...

I own a Logitech G560 (I think it's neat) and when i play music with the system volume at 70% and subwoofer level at 100, I think it makes a cricket-like noise? I'm not sure how to describe it and isn't audible in a video I took... Just know it's not there when music isnt playing... What could it be?"
audiophile,"I don't know too much about audio formats nor audio compression, but for ages I've wondered what's the name of a particular sound quality I hear everywhere, well, if it has one. I guess it can be classified as lossy: it feels like a vibration when high pitches hit, and it's not like other low-quality audio compressions. I don't know how to describe it, or even if it's a compression. It's simply uncomfortable. It appears frequently in old YT videos, when detected in music, so I'll give a few examples of it:

[https://youtu.be/rrVDATvUitA](https://youtu.be/rrVDATvUitA) Sounds like the audio quality I'm looking for around 4:50, being more noticeable on the highest note at 4:53.

[https://youtu.be/LkxNY5VypaI](https://youtu.be/LkxNY5VypaI) (Ignore the age-restriction) The entire background music has this compressed sounding, and when you compare it with the original song (Letter Box - Far the Days Come), the difference is undeniable.

So, although I think this isn't the aproppiate place to make this type of questions, I hope someone helps me and makes me understand what it actually is."
audiophile,"My company gives us a budget for buying speakers but with the caveat that they must be desk speakers and not have smart feature like Alexa.

20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection: The Best of Joan Armatrading

Seems to have just the right level of dynamics and the low end is given enough room to fill a room and punch when it needs to. Not a hint of compression or distortion.

Anyone have any recommendations for similarly great recordings of pop/modern soul? I'd love to enjoy Amy W but I find the compression/loudness tiring."
audiophile,"Hi.  Sorry, this is going to annoy many people.  Please bear with me.  I'll get the worst out of the way first - I own a pair of Phantoms.  There.  Done.

I'm trying to find an audio setup that sits within a comfortable middle ground where I can stream music from my devices (phone, pc, whatever), or from my DJ controller when I'm playing that, either for myself or small house parties (~30 people in the dance area). 

This is a continuation of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/114d7bh/house_party_speakers_in_apartment_mindful_of/) on /r/Beatmatch. 
The pair of Devialet Phantoms I own seem to work OK, and fill my space (high ceiling, fairly large space) if I'm ONLY streaming from my phone.  Past that....Pain in the ass.  I do like how they sound for the organic/downtempo-like genres I'm into.
It appears though that there is no way around the awkward reset/setup procedure required when switching them between low latency optical &amp; bluetooth modes - so, I began looking into separate speaker options that look decent in my space, can connect to my controller, and provide enough (but not too much) sound during a party.

I *don't* want:

* Fat, ugly PA speakers (powered or unpowered).  Yes, they provide enough sound, but they do not suit the space.
* Insane volume.  My neighbors are chill but I'd like to be respectful.
* $10k+ setup
* Two setups (IF POSSIBLE) - Ie. streaming setup (the Phantoms) and DJ/party setup (the whatever else).  This has been my intent once I figured out how annoying the Phantoms are (as they unfortunately don't seem to be the do-it-all option I hoped), but now I'm trying to see if there's a different middle-ground option from a single system.


I *do* want:

* Reasonable sound quality (I'm not an audiophile - I just want it to sound decent)
* Good, easy connectivity (BT from phone, PC, etc.).
* Connectivity from mixer/controller to same system

I've spoken to music stores on the professional/PA side and they recommend me to Home/Hifi stores.

Home/Hifi stores recommend me to the professional retailers.

Am I chasing a hopeless dream, or is there something that does (mostly) check all the boxes I'm not aware of?"
audiophile,"Currentely im searching for a new set of speakers. After using passive towers for years i want to switch it up for some smarter active shelf speakers.

I mainly look for two things:
1. wireless connectivity with google cast support
2. Hdmi EArc or optical connections to get a digital signal from a TV to the speakers

The best option i found so far would be the KEF LSX 2 oder LS50 Wireless 2. For my usecase and from what ive heard the LSX 2 unfortunately would be a little too small with not enough headroom in terms of bass and volume. The LS50 Wireless 2 seem basically perfect but cost more then im willing to spend on a speaker atm. Price limit is more around the 1500‚Ç¨ mark.

Looking forward to hear your recommendations!"
audiophile,"My dad has had them for a long time and said I could have them when I have my own car, are they good? I am probably still going to use them regardless."

I can't really listen to anything louder than -15db without it becoming uncomfortable. I have a large room with Polk L600s powered by an Anthem STR integrated amp. 

Who actually listens to reference level regularly, and how are you not getting hearing damage? Is that the level reviewers use to test equipment?"

audiophile,"This may all sound quite strange, but would like to know if it is all just on my mind or there may be other reasons and if anybody can relate.

I have a relatively cheap, but decent, setup with v-moda xs powered by a magni/modi stack attached to my laptop.

I usually listen to music while working and I have noticed, rather consistently, that in the morning is not as ""enjoyable"" as in the afternoon/evening.

By ""enjoyable"" I mean that the sound seems warmer, and especially with more full and deeper bass frequencies. Even the volume seems to get slightly higher and i get a general higher feeling of clarity and something that I would not know how to describe other than a ""warm punchiness""

Now I have been thinking of many possible reasons:

1. I'm not a morning person, maybe my mood is not great. Music is a highly dopaminergic activity, maybe there are biochemical reasons affecting how receptive I am to it?
2. Headphones breaking in? I have been using it hel quite extensively for weeks, so that would sound strange, even stranger that they would improve only in the evening instead of linearly over time
3. Amplifier warming up? Even though it is not a valve amplifier, there may still be some audible improvements after some time of usage? I have tried leaving it on all night (without music though), but does not seem to affect it. If this could be indeed a possibility, would it really take it hours to ""warm up""?
4. Ears/brain adaptation over time. Listening to music over a long period of time could affect how my ears and brain perceive and interpret it? Maybe I become more sensitive to certain frequencies, or less to others as a defense mechanism against ""noise""?

Any thoughts? Am I just going crazy?"

Hi guys,

I'm looking to buy a set of active bluetooth speakers in the range of 500-1000$. What I really like about the Edifier S3000PRO's is that there is no cable between the two speakers, so that you can place them anywhere in your place as long as there's a power socket nearby. I was wondering if there are other speaker sets with this same feature. I did some research online but without result yet. Would like to know if anybody can recommend a similar ""wireless""  speaker set.

So im looking for an upgrade, a proper upgrade so that I can enjoy some music and edit videos better. I do have a cheap audio interface that is the M Audio M Track Duo.


Currently i have eyes on:

Audiotechnica Ath M50X &amp; M40X (for detachable cable and foldable design)

Beyerdynamic DT770Pro (seems like more durable and comfortable also heard that i had good sound quality but only the 250ohm variant has coiled cables and velour earpads)

Sony MDR 7056 (cus it's cheap and used by many but heard a lot of people saying its harsh, idk whats harsh. Im by no mean an audio guy, idk what to expect for these typa headphones just know that they give a more accurate sound)

Sennheiser HD280 Pro (again cus its cheap and well built that the sony and it can fold)

Question is, I was thinking about buying a mic pre-amp, and using shielded cable from mic to amp, and to PC. Is this worth doing?
Or is the magnet in the mic possibly old/going bad. And adding an amp to it will just amplify the EM interference I'm already getting? Is there any off the shelf drop in replacement for these or would I have to epoxy a new magnet to the ass end of this guy?"

audiophile,"Do you guys sometimes also focus too much on the mix? 

‚Ä¢Everything in the center or are the vocals slightly panned? 
‚Ä¢ Why is there more going on in my left ear, am I having hearing loss in my right ear? 

Just to name a few examples. 

To give more context I suffer from OCD and it gets so bad I listen to the song in mono, different headphones or reverse stereo to see if something is wrong in the mix or if it‚Äôs my ear and I suffer hearing loss. 

It‚Äôs so annoying. I feel like the vocals tend always to be a tiny bit more left-sided, like I hear them centered but something off. When I pan my mix a bit too the right it does not centered .. just weird. 

TDLR; do you also freak out about stuff like that?"

audiophile,"So I am struggling to find a brand that makes a rugged speaker that has good base for a gym setting. I looked into some electro voice speakers but they apparently have very bad low frequency response and that is mostly what I listen to in the gym. They are though exactly what I am looking for build wise. Should I be looking at some speakers with big woofers?
Any advice would be appreciated!"
audiophile,"I don't know what anyone here thinks about Bandcamp.com as a music source. I've found jazz on there I didn't run into elsewhere. They give big downloads, but how do I tell if I'm getting anything more than 16 bit / 44.1 kHz?  Are the huge files just swollen with vanity megabytes?"
audiophile,Is there a very distinct difference in sound quality between amplifiers as you spend more on performance? What kind of differences can I expect by moving from a Technics SU-V96 to something more pricey.

audiophile,"Which would be louder sounding:

A) 2 speakers, each with a 6‚Äù diameter driver, 89db sensitivity at 4ohm, powered by 50 watts into each speaker

B) 4 speakers, each with the same 6‚Äù driver, same 89db sensitivity at 4ohm, but powered by 25 watts into each speaker

Basically trying to understand if bridging an amplifier to double the wattage into 2 speakers will be louder sounding than 4 speakers getting half as many watts. I couldn‚Äôt figure out the math myself, so looking for someone with a bigger brain to provide the equation."
audiophile,These are the best sounding speakers I have ever owned. I need advice for an audio source. I use spotify premium. I want hifi. My phone can do LDAC bluetooth so should I get a bluetooth receiver/dac to utilize this? Maybe a digital audio player? Help. I have a small but awesome 8ninch subwoofer to help and it's great.
audiophile,"Hi, all! I hope this isn't considered purchasing advice. I am more asking about the sound physics of it. I have only been a headphones guy up to now. 

* I use a standing desk with a clearance of at least 42"" (1m) (more after I get my balance board). 
* It is always up and will not be lowered to the seating position for the foreseeable future. 
* It's in a small 8'x8' (2.44mx2.44m) room. 
* I am more into music sounding ""fun"" rather than ""accurate"".

I was thinking about getting a pair of those 360¬∞ firing Ohm speakers, maybe the MicroWalshes or the Wash Tall 1000s, and putting them under my standing desk. How... how dumb is this? Like if I'm just watching YouTube or pumping some EDM or rap, will this work? Or will it be total dogshit? I haven't been able to find anyone discussing this."
audiophile,"Hello, 

This is my problem. I have an avr Onyx tx nr626. It has stopped working the sound of the two front speakers, left and right. The center, subwoofer and the other 7.1 satellites are still working.

I have checked by replacing those speakers, and the audio still does not work for those two channels.

I guess it will be some internal fault that will not be fixed, I ask if you can think of something to test, and also if there is a way to reset the device, in case I have touched something and I have disabled them.

Thank you very much"
audiophile,"I pretty recently got into high fidelity audio and I was wondering what would be a good option for listening to music at work if I work somewhere that requires me to leave my phone and any other devices that can record audio/video or have Bluetooth or do anything other than play music already downloaded onto it outside of the room I work in. As intense as that sounds the work I actually do is very dry, and music would definitely help break up the monotony. I know there‚Äôs audiophile oriented media players out there, but as far as I‚Äôve seen they‚Äôre all Bluetooth enabled or have an insane price tag. Keep in mind I can‚Äôt use my work computer for music either. I thought it would be funny to bring in my turntable but I‚Äôm obviously not going to do that. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

This amp doesn't seem to have a phono input and only has the classic line inputs such as Tape, Tuner/MP3 and CD/VCD. To my surprise the sound wasn't quiet as expected and played pretty loud/normal. Does my amp happen to have a built-in preamp despite having no phono in?"

Hey guys, just wanted get some advice on a speaker setup for my living room.
Moved in just this past week; we had this particularly room wired for 5.1, as it has 20+ft ceilings (22‚Äô?) and is open to kitchen and floating game room above it. Our intended purpose for this is more for family gatherings/parties and more music vs TV use; however, we do want to a TV here in the event we want to use it. The plan was to get a 65-75in Samsung Frame TV, and although not my favorite for a variety of reasons (I‚Äôm an LG OLED fan), has the best option to ‚Äúhide‚Äù if I were to place artwork around it.

We are looking some discrete in-wall speakers (color matched white grills) vs slim on wall speakers that will best blend in here. The rears are in the living area ‚Äúcorners‚Äù about 10ft up, not ideal but best spot we could prewire.

I have an Anthem MRX720 and Paradigm Defiance X15 sub that I am
planning on possibly pairing with the rest of the setup. I have a set of Paradigm Millenia XPLs that I was going to use for another room but like some of their in-wall offerings, like the Pro P3 LCR V2 (L/R), P1 LCR V2 (center) and premier 200B (white, surrounds) on mounts.

audiophile,"All,

I ordered the Polk R700 over three months ago and today finally one arrived but only one. I was told that the other one wouldn't arrive for at least another three months so I was given the option to upgrade both to the L600 for free. So my question is, are they comparable and has anyone heard the two side by side? I do have a R350 for a center and R200s for surrounds.

There are differences in the two series. The midrange and woofers in the L600 are a full inch smaller than the R700 and the R700 has the newer port design 2.0 vs. the L600. However the tweeter and midrange are the same (from what I can tell).

Any help would be appreciated."

audiophile,"New to this sub so apologize if any of this is off topic.

I got the Micca PB42x a couple days ago as my first desktop speakers and ordered the Dayton 800 sub to go along with. They sound great for my budget except that I started noticing a whooshing/distortion only from the left speaker yesterday.

Then I played this song (Nightride - Revisited, by A.L.I.S.O.N): https://open.spotify.com/track/6RAJmzLTahc9BB7rl4JT7y?si=Nx8AeWzVRQ2hc5HueH5MEg

When I play this song, there is a very audible strange distortion sound that comes out of the left speaker at the beginning of the song. When I play the song through my bose headphones it is not there. However, when I play the song simply through my iPhone speaker the distortion sound IS there.

Anyone have any idea what‚Äôs going on? I ultimately don‚Äôt care about my phone speaker, I just want the Miccas to sound good. Do I need to replace the left one or is there some other issue going on?"

audiophile,"Hi! I'm looking for a little bit of advise here.

I'm driving a pair of Wharfedale Linton Heritage speakers with a Yamaha MX-1000 and Rotel RC-06 preamp; before I had a Yamaha S-A301. What I've noticed is that on the S-A301 I could turn the volume knob up 1/4th or so to reach a desirable level whereas on this setup the slightest turn will make my speakers go *way too loud*. I'm aware my current amp is rated at least 200 watts more than then previous, which is probably the reason why (?).

I'd like to have a little bit more control over the volume control; what would be the best way? Obviously I have the L/R level knobs on my MX-1000 which I can turn back 50% but is this the best and only option?

Thanks!"

Amp: Topping LA90 - yes, I know ASR üòú Again, great amp, super clean and more than enough power for my needs.

Streamer / DAC: Matrix Audio Mini-i Pro 3 - the whole package for a Roon user like me. Basically no competition if it fits your specific requirements.

Sub: REL Tzero Mkiii - punchy, fast, adds depth to the sound in every sense. Great latest addition to the setup.

Also, I used HouseCurve for iPad with Umik-1 mic to create convolution filters in Roon. Such a great little app, which helped to tidy up the sound even more. Highly recommended, especially if REW is a bit much at first.

Even with no audio cables plugged in and them just switched on the hum was there and didn't change when adjusting the volume. I also found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BudgetAudiophile/comments/lajca2/do_all_small_cheap_active_monitors_hum_bx5_d3/) which matched my experience.  
This was pretty disappointing as I had owned some D2s years ago and didn't really experience this.  
So I got some Adam T5Vs and there's no hum at all, so I think the power supplies in the BX5s must be very cheap. Yes, they were cheap at ¬£80 each but the hum was so loud you could hear it even when playing music quietly, they were pretty much unusable.

Is this expected or is it worth pursuing replacements/refunds etc? Is this something that will get worse with age?

My local dealer is not very communicative, unfortunately, and, ""doesn't really have a return policy,"" so hoping to get some outside input before deciding what to do here.

I'm not sure if I'm being neurotic. Part of me is annoyed that these speakers were so expensive but have these micro gouges all over. TYIA!

What is the:  
\- *Best way to clean a CD?* Silkscreened top and plastic bottom. This Disc Cleaner Solution image is isopropyl and water. I don't know ratio though.  
\- *Best way to clean a plastic CD case?* I used the natural orange oil De-Solv-It cleaner for tape and label gunk but, after that, how to clean a dirty case? Cases are made from polystyrene. I don't think household De-Solv-It harms that.  
It is my impression that counter disinfectant wipes **do** harm polystyrene.   
\- *Best way to remove minor scratches on CD?*

I have used this Scotch product, which even seems to help with scratches but, it is a bit worn out. Maybe there is something *better* now for disc bottom cleaning?  
On one CD, that had a sticky substance on the bottom, I hit it with this solution and used an eyeglass micro fiber cloth to rub it off. I think this rotary cleaner may not even be needed. Just the microfiber we get from the optometrist does the same job combined with a distilled water and isopropyl mixture.

 Celebrities are very much human like the rest of us, despite that  popular culture exalts them to God-like levels. And as humans, famous  people have a multitude of curiosities and hobbies that scratch that  same itch we‚Äôre all after. Since money is often no object, those whose  passion is music proudly display hi-fi set-ups that transform the ritual  of deep listening into something sublime."
audiophile,"Hi! I have a question for you! I am using a Luxman Lv110 amplifier (8-16 ohm) with a Mission LX-4 Mk2 loudspeaker (nominal impedencia is 8 ohm, minimum impedancia is 4.3 ohm). Source is a laptop connected to a Topping E30 mk2. I am a bit worried about the ohm differenc.

Main question: Is there any possible problem showing up in this system?

Side question: What do you think about this setup?

Extra question: I am planning to buy a Sony TA A400 amplifier, what is 100 watt/channel on 8ohm. I am not sure what RMS is at 4.3 ohm gonna be. Can my loudspeaker being damaged by that amplifier?

Thank you for listening!"

audiophile,"Maybe it's just my personality, but I really \*really\* dig listening to music with others. I would love to share music in the listening space I've worked so hard to build. Unfortunately, I don't get m(any) takers. Everyone in my immediate family (I have a wife and five adult children) is perfectly happy listening to music on an Echo Dot or cheap earbuds. They admittedly ""don't get"" my obsession with spending hours in my home theater/music room. The only time they've expressed a degree of appreciation for the sound quality is when watching a movie in Dolby ATMOS. 

On the precious few occasions when someone does take me up on the offer, I'm very careful to listen to the music *they* want to listen to. I keep my conversation to a minimum so they can focus on enjoying what they hear. In short, I practice self-awareness so my comments/opinions/conversation doesn't intrude on their experience. However, if they DO ask questions about the hows and whys the music sounds so good, I'm more than happy to oblige with a short explanation.

Otherwise, I'm all alone when it comes to music and it's not for a lack of making invitations to friends and family. They just aren't interested :(

What would be *amazing* would be to find another audiophile I could totally geek out with. Unfortunately, I've been unable to cross paths with one in my small town."
audiophile,"I have multiple YouTube downloads that I've narrowed down to 2 different audio sources, however I can't decide between the two. *^(Using YouTube-DLP to download)*

I.E:

* Better compression ratios to reduce file sizes *^(despite bandwidth limits vastly increasing and storage sizes being literal cents per gigabyte.)*

**Question1:**

So my question is, when comparing the above file formats, which produces the higher quality audio? I assume m4a in the case however size does not = better audio. Bit rate is a lot higher however sample rate is lower. 

**Question 2:**

There are also times where both examples are the same bit rate, however m4a always has a 441000Hz sample rate. So as a second question, if everything else is equal however M4a has a lower sample rate, would Webm produce higher quality audio or m4a?"

audiophile,I am thinking of connecting an old laptop I have that has a 1394 output to my dvd player which has a DV Camcorder (also 1394) and through it (via Scart) to a television and speakers (via RCA). Is this going to work or am I loosing my time trying to find the cable?
audiophile,"Hello, first post.

I want to add a subwoofer to my office setup (small room about 3mx6m), primarily to get some more low end extension for gaming and music. I currently have kef q150's with a Topping stack, dx3pro+ and pa3s. I already have some y splitters coming out of the Dac for eventually adding a subwoofer.

It seems to be very hard to find anything concrete about the options in my pricerange, below 300 Euros. I cannot justify spending 400+ for something like a SVS considering the total cost of my existing setup. Even the new budget sub from BK will run more than 300, if I can get it shipped to The Netherlands.

Enter the Polk XT12, for 250 Euros it seems to tick most of the boxes. Some comments say its underpowered, but for my setup (small room + nearfield) I cannot believe that will be a problem. It's quite a chonker, but I don't mind a cheeky footrest under the desk. 12"" woofer seems to be an advantage over something like the Cambride minx stuff, in a similar price-range.

Is this a decent deal and does anyone have any experience with this sub? Are there better options around \~250 in Europe (NL)?

(Im a bit worried how the auto-on function would with y-splitters, but I will just ask Polk directly about that)"
audiophile,"Many years ago I remember seeing speakers that perhaps looked a bit like BW 800 (memory is very blurry), but had round flat diaphragm midrange? drivers also in a spheres, the diaphragm had triangle shapes around its edges pointing towards the center of the diaphragms If I recall correctly.

They were known for extreme SPL and transient response, like they could almost reproduce a gunshot. Very exotic and expensive. Arrived in large pallet boxes I believe from USA but not 100% sure.

It was more than 10 years ago, but perhaps someone can point me in the right direction?"

audiophile,"Hi fellow audiophiles,

I need some insight from everyone. I have done tons of research on different amplifier types, brands, power ratings etc. I have narrowed down my selection to a handful of amplifiers and cannot decide which one to choose to my pair with my new Revel F208s. 

I currently use a 5 year old Marrantz AV receiver as a DAC, which I will upgrade in the future. My current amplifier is a Emotiva A2 that has served me well, but I need something with a little more current as the bass response seems a little anemic compared to what I heard in the show room.

I have been looking at either a Hypex NC500 or Purifi 1ET400A model from Nord Audio or VTV. Nord Audio for aesthetics and quality. VTV for bang for your buck for performance ratio. I have also been considering the Parasound A23+ or a Monolith 2x200 which seems to be manufactured by the reputable ATI. Any recommendations or insight? 

For my future DAC, I have been considering the MiniDSP SHD or the Camridge CXN V2 if that makes a significant difference."
audiophile,"Hi all,

Compatibility question.

My current setup is a Cayin A-50t integrated tube amp with pioneer CS-77 speakers. I want to upgrade the speakers and there‚Äôs a pair of ADS L810s for sale locally. I‚Äôve read great things but I‚Äôm concerned that my amp will not have enough wattage to drive them. The ADS are 6ohm and 100w nominal. efficiency: 94db The cayin is 35w per channel with 4 or 8ohm options. 

Would the ADS L810 a good pairing with my cayin, or should I keep shopping?"
audiophile,"...but with what?

I would like to go a little higher on power (100? 120?) and have better phono preamp and DAC than my other components, so it can serve me for another 10 years.

I listen to metal 80% of the time and the rest is jazz, classical, rock, electronic.

I like the integrated amplifier concept as it economizes in space, so I'm not looking for discrete options unless they fit in the budget and provide superior value. 

My budget is 1500-2000, and could exceed it for a couple of hundred for something special. 

(Is the new C3050 the answer to my quest?)

The whole system is still serviceable, but some of the blue LEDs on the front plate have died or are severely dimmed.

Rest of system:
B&amp;W CM9 (s1)
Audio Technica AT-LP7
Oppo BDP-103 (for CD and hi-rez audio via USB/SACD/DVD-A)
Sonos Connect (internet streaming and local library with 16/44 lossless files)

audiophile,"Hey guys, 

Just purchased a Yamaha RX-V4A amp and wanted to ask about pairing the speakers and subwoofer. Budget is \~$200/ea for speakers and $200-300 for the subwoofer. Currently looking at the Klipsch package deal, (2) R-820Fs and (1) R-120SW for $797 on Klipsch website ([https://www.klipsch.com/products/r-820f-r-120sw-subwoofer-2-1-speaker-system](https://www.klipsch.com/products/r-820f-r-120sw-subwoofer-2-1-speaker-system)).

audiophile,"So I just upgraded from an older pair of active kanto yumis bookshelf speakers (class AB, around 700 bucks) to a pair of $2000 triangle borea 08s running through a Yamaha As-300, source is fluance RT-82 with orotofon OM20 and schiit mani preamp. 

I do like the sound of triangles - they have amazing bass response and fullness in the low end. It's like listening to new music. Its crazy. They also have exceptionally crisp and clear high end (cymbals, snares, etc), and 
a big, dyanmic sound stage with excellent separation. Hearing way more instruments and depth of detail on the instruments. 

However, the midrange seems to be far more 
 subdued than my old bookshelves. Its less tight, punchy, clear, and upfront. You just don't get the wow factor when listening to heavy guitars, etc. I've moved the speakers around, played with EQ, but it seems to remain this way. 

I'm wondering if this is how these speakers sound, or if this is just the difference between bookshelves and floorstanders. While its fun listening to all the new sounds, I'm really missing those tight, clear mids and thinking I may have made a mistake...

 Any insight appreciated!

Thanks."

audiophile,"Hello, so I have been using my old Sansui AU7500 as a home theater amplifier for a while now. It sounds good when it works but it only really works when I have it turned loud. It seems to work when I listen to music that has a lot going on sound-wise. But when I watch movies with dialog and other low volume scenes it tends to make a fuzzy noise and the volume kind of fades away and gets distorted. To fix it I need to walk a turn the volume knob a bit and then it seems like it ""turns on"" again. It also helps when I twist other knobs and buttons about, like there is some built up static or something that is being let away?

I don't know much about fixing this stuff and I didn't find much info on the model online but I was hoping someone could help me identify the problem. I have gotten pretty tired of this and would be happy if it just worked because I like the sound.

Thanks"
audiophile,"**TLDR: Listened to a Denon PMA-1600NE with two 3rd party power cords and perceived a change in sound quality. Is there any scientific rationale why a better power cord could affect an amp's sound quality?**

----

I've been looking to replace my amp of 11 years that broke (and is unrepairable) that is paired with a pair of Monitor Audio RX2s and an Oppo 205.

Today I play tested an older Denon PMA-1600NE as it was around the same price point as my previous amp (with a discount). At one point, the sales guy suggested I listen to it with two different 3rd party power cords: one priced around $100 (Cord A because I forget the name) and the other around $280 (Nordost Blue Heaven).

I was pretty skeptical I'd hear any substantial difference, but given that I've never actually tried such a comparison before due to my inherent skepticism about paying a premium for such parts, I figured why not. I play tested with a simple modern piano and solo violin piece (Ludovico Einaudi - DNA).

Without changing the volume meter, he swapped the original cord for Cord A. To my ears, it was immediately clear that it was louder. It was a slight change but I also thought the instruments felt like they had more space between them.

Swapping to the Nordost, I couldn't perceive any volume changes (quieter or louder). However, I immediately felt the it was much easier to position each instrument. I also felt like the sound stage got a bit taller, like a giant piano and violin were being played and I had to look up to see the whole instrument. Not that the sound was coming from above, down at me, but that the sound filled the space vertically.

Frankly, I was surprised because I didn't think changing a power cord on an amp could exert such a change. As I said before, I didn't go into this expecting to hear differences so I don't think it's any sort of placebo/self-fulfilling prophecy effect.

**Is there a scientific reason why the quality of a power cord can affect the quality of the sound in such ways? Volume sort of makes sense (more power = more volume), but what about my experience with the Nordost?**"
audiophile,"Hey all - I'm wondering if anyone can recommend a brand/system for a setup I'm hoping to put together.

I would like a pair of wireless speakers that I can use as computer speakers, but also as portable speakers in the kitchen, living room, etc. when connected to my phone. What I can't figure out is if such a product is available that will also connect wirelessly to a sound bar to act as surround speakers. 

I was looking at the Sonos Ray sound bar and the Roam but while the Roams can connect to the Ray to share a music source, they won't work as surrounds.

I have limited square footage and a relatively limited budget, so I'm hoping for something of an all-in-one system.

Thanks."
audiophile,"I have been using a bose quiet comfort 35Q for a couple of years but have decided to upgrade my audio equipment. Today I visited an audio store and tried out a couple of headsets in the 1000$ price range. My favorite was the Meze 109 Pro which I have decided to buy, but I also need a DAC. All the headsets I tested were wired to the FiiO K5 DAC. After I chose the headset I asked the guy working there for buying advice on a good DAC for the Meze 109 and he told me the FiiO K7 was probably one of the best DACS for this headset in this price range. The guy was really nice and knowledgeable about audio so I have good reason to believe him. But I have to remember that his job is to sell me products and he was only recommending stuff they actually had. Is the FiiO K7 a good DAC for this headset?

Since most of the audio gear comes with the type F plugs, will there be any issues if I want to plug it all into type C? Or would I have to get an electritian to install a few type F where I want my stereo?

audiophile,"Due to some renovations and shrinking space I need to move my Paradigm towers to another space. For the renovated room, the space constraints and furniture will mean On-wall only (not in-wall as it is an exterior wall facing north very close to Georgian bay and darn cold out in the winter and I have no intention of messing with the insulation factors.

Just this week I was able hear totems for the first time. I audition some Totem KIN Solos and Tribe III side by side. I liked both but the tribes were especially great. Good transparency and decent imaging and fairly substantial bass, all better then I expected from on-wall. The tribes are very top end of my budget. And i suspect might demand a better amp than others? Only a wild guess really.

It was a listening room with only Totem products so I couldn‚Äôt really compare colouration with other speaker brands that I know.  And im it was a better room for sound than mine will be.  I‚Äôm curious how forgiving you think the Tribes are? I moved around the room a fair bit and they seemed to be good outside the prime position. 

I have yet to find a location to audtion PSB‚Äôs PWM line of on-walls. I‚Äôm particularly curious about the PMW2 as it is a 3-way speaker, and about the same footprint as the tribe III, and currently about 25% less than the tribes. My first speakers ever were PSB waaaay back. So I‚Äôd be very curious.

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone here has listened closely to the PWM2 for music? I can barely even find reviews. Or especially if you also know the Totem Tribe IIIs as well.

Content is lots of instrumental jazz old and new (miles to metheny), some vocal, some contemporary big band, lots of steely Dan, fagen, sting, some classic rock, prog (Floyd, genesis et Al) blues (SRV, buddy guy, BB), lots of r&amp;b funk like Tower of Power, Earth Wind and Fire etc.

I‚Äôve also been told that since I live only about 2 hours from the axiom head quarters that I owe them a drive and a listen. So any comments about the colouration, detail, imaging compared to tribe III or PWM would be welcome."

audiophile,"Newbie question here so please be kind.

I have a large number of FLAC files on a QNAP NAS device with Twonky installed as a DLNA server.  


I feed this over wifi to a Wiim mini (the round one, not the new square one with ethernet, but I want to get that next.   


This plays to a Teradak DAC via Toslink and from there into my naim system.  


The sound is astonishingly good for good recordings.  


I run the Hifi Cast player to choose tracks and adjust the volume. There can be very loud scratchy sounds if I restart a track or if I let the phone go into auto lock or battery save mode, and have to restart playback. When the music starts back up these harsh noises stop.  


I control the volume with my phone running this app. My question is, where is this volume being applied?  


I never walk over to the naim gear to touch the volume - I have it turned up so volume settings are reasonable from 0 to 50, with 30-40  being loud enough, 20 not enough, 50 too loud. I leave the naim pre-amp set so the numbers work for my preferred listening levels.  


But where in the signal path is the volume being changed and how?   


I am guessing that the Hifi Cast app on my phone sends the volume levels to Twonky which digitally alters the volume of the stream going from the NAS to the Wiim. Or, it could be that the Wiim is doing this volume modulation before it goes to the DAC.  


The convenience of adjusting the volume from my phone is significant, but if there is a better way to connect things so the DAC is getting the best signal and no damage is being done to the music by the volume being baked into the digital stream to the DAC.  


Also, what can I do to minimize the harsh scratching noises when the DAC loses its input for whatever reason it is now?  


My upgrade path is to get the wiim Pro and hard wire the ethernet to my router, and then look at devices to improve the network connections, with better Ethernet and clock signals, etc. Nothing specifically planned yet.  


Any wisdom from those who know more than me?"
audiophile,"Hey everyone! I'm entirely new to this sub and I'm in the process of looking up my first setup. I'm on a budget of about 600 to 800$ and have a Question:

I want to listen to both CDs from a CD player for best quality as well as have the option to stream music off my cell phone via Spotify or watch a movie with good headphones. My idea was to get both a Topping A50s and a D50s for this; but then I'd have to constantly connect and disconnect the cables going into the A50s depending on wether I wanted to listen from a digital or an analog source, right?
Now I'm thinking about getting a Topping A50s and a Topping DX3 pro+; the former for listening from CDs (I have a CD player with analog output), the latter for streaming and watching TV with an optical output; thusly not having to switch all the time as I'm streaming directly to the DX3 pro+ and have an optical cable connected for signal coming from the TV.

Does this make sense? Am I missing something? Could I stream directly to the D50s? Could this be done simpler? I'm just getting into the hobby, these are my first babysteps. And I had a long working day, do my brain might overlook the obvious here.

It's really disturbing as for a guy who played a lot of live music, even for a sake of ""best sound"" I don't think this ""slowness"" sounds anything like real life, and the lack of dynamics really makes me wanna get rid of them and maybe buy something that would be more pleasant and simply fun to listen music to.

Do you have any experience with those? 

Is it all monitors that have this ""problem""?

At this point my laptop speakers sound more exciting than those haha XD Which should not be the case I believe.

Maybe I'm doing something wrong with some hardware? I am running these through UMC204HD, which should be just fine for it's purpose.

Let me know your thoughts!"
audiophile,"Sorry if this is a dumb question.

I know that amplifier's RMS change based on the Ohms, does the same thing apply to speakers? 

I have two 4 Ohm DVC subwoofers that are rated at 500w RMS at 4ohms. I want to wire them to 1 ohm. 

Would an 1 Ohm 1000W RMS amp be the correct choice?"

*Plenty of power (likely 100+ watts @8 ohm) for low sensitivity speakers (86db)
*USB and multiple optical inputs in addition to RCA
*Sub pre out with high pass filter that varies sub out volume with the speaker outputs (many just have a fixed volume out and fixed low pass filter)
*Can be found for $1200 or under (even if refurbished or used)

Want to have:
*Bluetooth
*Wireless streaming

audiophile,"So recently I fell down the audiophile rabbit hole. I began nerding out all things like vinyl vs CD vs streaming, bits, compression, range, blah blah blah, equipment, and mastering. Sorry if I sound naive, it‚Äôs because I quite am if I‚Äôm being honest.

I currently have some cheap, old Klipsch speakers (don‚Äôt get me wrong, they sound great to me) and was looking at acquiring a nice setup to go along with them and start collecting albums.

I thought I would get into vinyl for the nostalgia and the warm, full sound of the records. I added a Fluance RT82 turntable to my cart and picked out a decent preamp and thought I was all set. 

Well then I began looking into CDs, they are nostalgic (man I feel old) and apparently the sound quality is better in every measurable way, at least that‚Äôs what they say. But there are those who swear their vinyl album sounds better than its CD counterpart. Not trying to get into the debate of CD vs Vinyl, but from what I could gather is it sort of depends. It depends on the music and the mastering.

So if certain albums do sound better on certain mediums or remasters are for better or worse‚Ä¶ Are there any sources out there that act as a guide to what album sounds best on what or if a particular remastered version is best?

One example I see mentioned a lot is the Death Magnetic album: it‚Äôs terrible on CD, better on vinyl, and best from Guitar Hero because it is actually a remastered version."

I'm a total beginner, but form what I understand, Crossover Frequency determines which frequencies go through the subwoofer? I assume the 40Hz end are the low frequencies, and 120Hz the high ones. To get max bass though the subwoofer, should it be set to 40Hz?

I recently dicovered Tidal. It is a competitor of sotify that offers better quality and better paiement for artists.

I am very convinced by the sound quality as well as their direct artist payout program (10% of subscription fee are directed to each subscriber‚Äôs most-listened-to artist for the month) .

Now, I am a bit concerned about the fact that it uses 3 to 4 times more data than spotify actually does.

I recently listened to a podcast about streaming's environmental impact. What I remember best about it is that basically the majority of the impact of streaming is the end devices that we own (buying new computer and smartphone every 3 years etc)... So in the end I am not sure if consuming more streamed data as a big impact or not.

I tend to pay attention to the environnemental impact of most my actions but I try to live the life I want (for eg I use my bike as much as I can, I don't take plane for personal purpose but I 'd still drive 1000km to practice my favorite activity for a week several times a year)

I am facing a dilemma and I miss some information make my decision.

TIDAL VS ANYTHING ELSE:

PROs: 

\- direct artist paiement

\- sound quality

CON:

\- potential additional impact of data consumtion , I need to know quantify that impact

I need help getting external DACs to work correctly on my 2019 Macbook Pro M1.

I experience audio stutters as soon as I have a high system load. The stutters occur once every few minutes, each lasting only very short. The audio quality itself is excellent, and the DAC itself work fine.

The problem happens with the following DACs:
- Topping E70
- SMSL SU-8
- iFI Zen V2

Things I've tried: 
- Change the audio format in Audio Midi Setup - no difference
- connect the DACs to a different USB port - either on a passive USB 2.0 Hub that is linked to my Thunderbolt Docking Station or going to the Thunderbolt Docking Station directly
- Restarting and updating the firmware (where possible)
- Disabling ""Set time and date automatically"" - this seems to improve the stutters minimally
- Try different audio sources (they all stutter)

The problem is undoubtedly related to the Macbook because a Windows Laptop has no issues using the DACs with the same setup/docking station.

If I had to guess, my Mac has an issue with the USB 2.0 port, which is the common connector of all DACs. I also found some forum posts from around 2018 with that issue (see [here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7906975))


Do you have any other ideas of what I could try? I'm at my wit's end, ordering several DACs from Amazon to see if one device magically works.

Hi everyone!

I was just wondering, what is the best way to connect my Yamaha HS8 speakers to my PS5. Browsing through similar posts, I can see that people have suggested plugging in an XLR to 3.5MM cable directly from the speakers into the display monitor. This way the display monitor controls the volume of the speakers.

Currently, I have the speakers connected to my Behringer UMC404HD (via TRS), which is connected to my PC through a USB cable. Is there a way of connecting the audio interface to the PS5, rather than the display monitor through a split cable? A HDMI audio extractor looks like something that can be used to achieve this, but I'm unsure how to set it up.

Any help is appreciated!"

* Dirac Live is impressive - I've always struggled a bit to blend the bookshelves with the subwoofer, and Dirac showed me it's because of some annoying reflections in the 60 to 100 Hz range.  With Dirac enabled, I can set the crossover anywhere from 60 to 80 Hz and it sounds perfectly blended
* Placebo?  It could be confirmation bias, but familiar songs sound ""better"" to me.  I don't know if it's the DAC of the amp or the Dirac, or maybe all three, but I have been enjoying the hell out of listening to Tidal hi-fi and a few of my favorite records

Total cost: $366

I built this for a house party I will be throwing in the near future. I am absolutely blown away by the quality of this setup. It is easily the best sound quality and highest clarity of any speaker setup I have heard in anyone's house. When you go out to a club or the movies the volume is so high that the sound seems a little distorted or muddy. Not so with the panel speakers. You can hear each individual instrument very clearly. I have been playing my favorite songs over and over hearing components of the song that were obscured with the inferior bluetooth speaker I used before this. I haven't really cranked the volume yet on this setup because I don't want to disturb the neighbors but even at 50% it fills up the entire house.

The speakers are 4'x2' and I still have to sand the sheen off a bit and then spray paint them so I don't have these giant pink rectangles floating in my living room. I am surprised that this technology is not more widely spread. I would think you could build a bar/club with these suspended from the ceiling and have absolutely amazing sound quality.

It was a fixer upper so no harm done, and when the base isn't super loud it works fine.

audiophile,"Hi everyone, I wanted to ask for your guidance on improving the sound from my record player setup. 

I am currently using a U Turn Orbit Plus into a U Turn pre amp, into a Denon AVRX3400H, which is driving bi-amp‚Äôd JBL 590 studios. 

I wound up with this setup because I wanted a 5.1 surround sound for home theater, and a 2.1 channel stereo for records, and I wanted the minimal number of devices. I also game using the AV receiver so modern features like 4k 120Hz pass through are important for me. The Denon receiver I use has a record player mode that turns off circuitry (including the lights on the front) to minimize interference. 

I am wondering what one thing i could change to improve the sound quality for my records. The JBL speakers are fine but i think they might be better suited for home theater‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd be totally fine to move to a dedicated stereo amp if that would help, but it is super convenient to just have the one unit.

I hope you're all having a great day. I've recently started experiencing some trouble with my D90se/A90 system that I've owned for the past six months and I could use some help.

So, after using my system for a few hours, the sound becomes imbalanced with a difference of around 2-3 dB on either the right or left channel. It's really hard to know if I have the problem right now or if it's just the video I'm playing, because the difference is so small. I've tried unplugging the cables (4-pin XLR, 6.3mm and 4.4mm) and plugging them back in and that fixes the problem temporarily, but it just keeps happening again after a few hours of use.

I have taken the necessary steps to resolve the issue, such as installing all necessary drivers and even reinstalling a new version of Windows, but to no avail. The problem persists.

I use Spotify to stream in the car. I went to an audio shop recently, and they said that I just need better tweeters. Is the change that simple? Any other recommendations? Suggestions?"
audiophile,"Hey everyone! I have had a pair of the Tannoy Xt-6F speaker for about 2 years now and absolutely love them.

audiophile,"I wanted to pickup the Q990B for the wireless Rear Speakers it comes with. However, I only have space to place them in the front. The other restriction is that the only front placement for them is on top of 6 foot high bookshelf's on either side of the TV.

Is that just a waste of money since the only placement for them is that high? My backup is the Q800B which is just the Bar and the Sub. I don't want to drop double the money if the 6 foot high front speakers are going to sound awful."

I currently have a [Sonos Amp](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/amp) powering 2 [Polk Atrium 8s](https://www.crutchfield.com/S-lPRaoImntBT/p_107ATR8SDW/Polk-Audio-Atrium8-SDI-White.html?XVINQ=GZ0&amp;XVVer=KNN&amp;awcr=628150042493&amp;awdv=m&amp;awnw=g&amp;awug=9032493&amp;awkw=pla-1831977151131&amp;awmt=&amp;awat=pla&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgJjUttiO_QIV7hvUAR3rlA3zEAQYASABEgI5L_D_BwE). Each speaker is hooked up as a stereo speaker (4 wires to each speaker). It‚Äôs nice because then you don‚Äôt have a left speaker right speaker over the large patio. 

Im thinking about adding a 3rd atrium 8 speaker. Can the amp handle it? Can it handle it without compromising the sounds of the other 2?

From Sonos website: 

How many passive speakers can Amp power?
Amp can power two pairs of 8-ohm nominal passive speakers wired in parallel. Amp can power three pairs of Sonos Architectural by Sonance wired in parallel.

I am trying to upgrade my current setup composed of :
- Amp : Sony str dh190
- 2 old Cabasse sampan 310
- Nvidia shield
- Samsung TV

The Amp is connected to the TV via HDMI ARC using a DAC, and RCA output.


I would like to have your opinion on the Bose freespace 3s satellites speakers. The setup would be a bit like this one :

Without the center speaker.

Does it make sense? Would it be a great addition to the current setup?

And lastly, I don't understand how you connect the speakers themselves? Using a standard banana cable?

I already have a high end system in my living room for a true audiophile experience, so I'm not looking for the cream of the crop for this. Instead, I'm looking for speakers that will sound similarly or better than the Sennheiser RS 180 headphones I normally use.

I usually work while listening to music with my headphones, but I don't like using headphones for Zoom calls, so I switch back and forth, which gets tiring. Therefore, I was hoping I could get a pair of speakers that sound decently well for zoom and music during the work day. Plus, I play video games with my daughter watching, so having sound would be nice for her :)

Any recommendations? I'm fine with anything in the $300+ range, hopefully not more than $500

However, I don't really trust the Android ones as I'm not sure how they will hold in the future (I stream my music via Qobuz), plus I have a hard time justifying the price tag.

audiophile,"Hello, 

here is the new country album of Shania Twain Queen Of Me.

https://preview.redd.it/ypbachju4kha1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4792c5d5e0eadde9511898f658619f60845c1d2c

For this review we compared the Qobuz Hi-Res, Tidal Master and Apple Lossless stereo versions which are presented in high resolution 24bit 96 kHz and also the Apple Dolby Atmos version.

I was very much expecting this style of music to escape the loudness war, but it's a DR5 against a DR12 for the Dolby Atmos version as shown in the graph below with the comparison of the waveforms between stereo and Atmos Binaural. We can see the effect of the limiter on the stereo version.

https://preview.redd.it/5guf1ewv4kha1.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ea8d9c5050aa6688ef5a3836efdaea9a19a12a9d

But, if we zoom in, we realize that the work of the dynamic limiter produces clipping as shown in the graph below, it is a source of degradation and distortion of the signal as explained [here](https://magicvinyldigital.net/2023/01/07/loudness-war-the-limit-of-the-0db-in-digital-or-analog-better-than-digital/). We should not see clipping in 2023 with all the tools available to control an audio file. 

https://preview.redd.it/9w9ouurx4kha1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dc05fb0c756f31086ecc818b37800053cd472ad8

In addition to this difference, the stereo version has a higher treble level bringing a brighter and more flattering sound than the Atmos version.

In the end, the dynamics and the sound opening is more pleasant on the Dolby Atmos version, which can be downmixed to listen in stereo.

You will find the extracts and all the measurements [here](https://magicvinyldigital.net/2023/02/11/shania-twain-queen-of-me-review-qobuz-hi-res-tidal-master-apple-music-lossless-dolby-atmos/).

Big client of mine has the following set-up:
LG OLED
Denon AVR w/ 5.1 System

URC MX-790 I programmed.

HDMI ARC from OLED to Denon. Directv in Denon

When I left a few months ago, everything worked great. But now, Netflix (from the LG TV apps) won‚Äôt play audio through the Denon. 

HDMI Control = On
Audio Out = HDMI ARC
Sound Out = HDMI/ARC
eARC = On
Simplink = On

But no sound from the TV at all. When I even try using the LG magic remote for volume (because I have eARC/Control on) it has a big ‚ÄúX‚Äù where volume is on the right. Whereas before, it would change volume via the AVR. 

If I switch to Cable, everything works great. Sound through the Denon and everything. But I go back to the apps of the TV, no sound at all. If I switch to the internal speakers, sound works through the TV. I thought it was an HDCP issue but I tried a new cable and didn‚Äôt work.

audiophile,"I recently ""upgraded"" from the Dali Oberon 5 to Wharfedale Linton Heritage as a 2.0 system for both music and TV/movies.

Having now had them for almost 2 months, I have come to a fairly disappointing conclusion: I prefer the sound of the (much cheaper) Dali Oberon speakers to the Wharfedale Linton. Given the amount of money I spent on the new speakers, this is a rather painful conclusion.

I've tried moving the speakers around the room, tried with different amounts of toe in, distance from the wall, etc. wondering if it is a placement thing, but no matter where I put them, the Dali speakers sound better to me.

I'm not really equipped with the language to pinpoint exactly what the difference is. There is nothing *wrong* with the Wharfedales, per se. It's more an absence of anything exciting. They feel a bit *dead*. I notice this most with strings, such as in the main theme to The Queen's Gambit. With the Dali Oberons, the strings feel like they are soaring. It feels like an airy concert hall. Not in the ""soundstage"" sense of being able to position the sound in a 3D space. Just in the sense of roominess and scale. Whereas the Wharfedale speakers just sound a bit dull in comparison. They just sound like sound coming from speakers.

It's the same story using them with the TV - dialogue is clearer via the Dali speakers (though still pretty decent through the Wharfedales) while still delivering on the soundtrack.

The only thing I prefer with the Wharfedale speakers is how they look in my living room.

I'm now just struggling with what to do with this realisation. It's definitely too late to return them to the shop. Due to their size, there isn't anywhere else in the house for them. The only option seems to be to sell them, probably at a discount, but it is quite painful to lose a substantial wedge of cash on something I have only recently bought.

Ideally I would find some neat trick that would make me like the Lintons more, allowing me to keep them and proceed with the original plan of selling the Dalis... 

Perhaps someone here who knows more about these speakers than me can identify what is going on to cause me to like one over the other, and advise whether there is something I can do with the Wharfedale Lintons to improve my experience of them.

(For reference, I am using both sets of speakers with the Leak Stereo 130.)"

audiophile,"I've found a lot of info online about active vs passive speakers but none about when an active speaker drives a passive one. That's why I'm here for help :)

Basicly there are active speakers that function as a normal speaker and an amplifier for another passive speaker at the same time.

For example look at the Fun Generation PK115A and PK115P or Behringer PK115A and PK115P combo:

https://www.thomann.de/gb/fun_generation_party_set_xl.htm?shp=eyJjb3VudHJ5IjoiZ2IiLCJjdXJyZW5jeSI6NCwibGFuZ3VhZ2UiOjJ9&amp;reload=1

A setup like this sounds quite good from a budget perspective, only having to by one speaker that's ""smart"" (bluetooth, mic in, eq etc) but still having two speakers.

Since I havent heard anything about these kind of systems is there anything I'm missing? Info online is basicly 0 and there is nothing in the manuals either :/

Does the active speaker only output at half the power when used as an amplifier and speaker at the same time? Is there still stereo sound or are they both on the same chanel?

For example the SENNHEISER - IE 600 is the most expensive iem I have ever own. Yes it might not be the most expensive one for others but it took me some time to save some money to own it. In general the planer magnetic iems/headphones are a bit on the costlier side. If I am spending a price more than what costed the  SENNHEISER what difference I am expected to feel with  the planer ones. That's what I want to know. I do have a  SCHIIT - FULLA E dac/amp/pre-amp (not the most expensive ones ) which might not be a problem in running a planer as I came to know those require some real power to run in their peak potential ; Throw some light on this as well if possible. In short is the money spent on a planer is worth it or not as it seems buying a good pair of planer does require some expenditure (I know their are cheap inexpensive ones as well in the market but not interested in those)."

I've been reading and some people say that you should buy a DAC to get a better audio signal. I'm new to all of this audio stuff and I would like to know if this is what I should do, and if that's the case which DAC should I buy? My budget is around 70 USD. Thanks for your help.

audiophile,"Hello. I am nearing the end of a painful renovation of a house and am finally starting to think about nice things such as what I should do for a sound system. 

I'm attached to my old Denon CD/Amp/Aux which has been a loyal soldier and still sounds good (for cds, records, music off something plugged into it) in a not very big apartment. But we're soon going to have much more space for ourselves and I am a bit lost when it comes to figuring out a solid sound setup for TV/music/occasional gaming in our new living room. 

I am not looking for shopping tips but would be keen to hear what others have done or if there are any bits of kit that you regard as key elements. I've never had a soundbar, so would one make things much better? Is a single good big speaker better than several small ones? Should bluetooth be forgotten?"

audiophile,"Hello, I want to know about this because I want to save my favorite songs in my own PC or USB, but I don't know what type of format can I use, I heard about FLAC is one of the better options because it sustains the quality. But I don't know if It's better the MP3 because It's the most common so I guess it would be easily accepted by all type of audioplayers but FLAC would be more difficult to being accepted. But I think WAV holds the quality like FLAC and it's more common, Sorry if I'm saying silly things lol, I don't know much about the audio."

audiophile,"Interesting piece.

&gt;In 2013, workers at a German construction company noticed something odd about their Xerox photocopier: when they made a copy of the floor plan of a house, the copy differed from the original in a subtle but significant way. In the original floor plan, each of the house‚Äôs three rooms was accompanied by a rectangle specifying its area: the rooms were 14.13, 21.11, and 17.42 square metres, respectively. However, in the photocopy, all three rooms were labelled as being 14.13 square metres in size. The company contacted the computer scientist David Kriesel to investigate this seemingly inconceivable result. They needed a computer scientist because a modern Xerox photocopier doesn‚Äôt use the physical [xerographic process](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/why-paper-jams-persist) popularized in the nineteen-sixties. Instead, it scans the document digitally, and then prints the resulting image file. Combine that with the fact that virtually every digital image file is compressed to save space, and a solution to the mystery begins to suggest itself.  
&gt;  
&gt;Compressing a file requires two steps: first, the encoding, during which the file is converted into a more compact format, and then the decoding, whereby the process is reversed. If the restored file is identical to the original, then the compression process is described as lossless: no information has been discarded. By contrast, if the restored file is only an approximation of the original, the compression is described as lossy: some information has been discarded and is now unrecoverable. Lossless compression is what‚Äôs typically used for text files and computer programs, because those are domains in which even a single incorrect character has the potential to be disastrous. Lossy compression is often used for photos, audio, and video in situations in which absolute accuracy isn‚Äôt essential. Most of the time, we don‚Äôt notice if a picture, song, or movie isn‚Äôt perfectly reproduced. The loss in fidelity becomes more perceptible only as files are squeezed very tightly. In those cases, we notice what are known as compression artifacts: the fuzziness of the smallest *jpeg* and *mpeg* images, or the tinny sound of low-bit-rate [MP3s](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-warm-glow-of-the-blog-rock-era).  
&gt;  
&gt;Xerox photocopiers use a lossy compression format known as *jbig*2, designed for use with black-and-white images. To save space, the copier identifies similar-looking regions in the image and stores a single copy for all of them; when the file is decompressed, it uses that copy repeatedly to reconstruct the image. It turned out that the photocopier had judged the labels specifying the area of the rooms to be similar enough that it needed to store only one of them‚Äî14.13‚Äîand it reused that one for all three rooms when printing the floor plan.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact that Xerox photocopiers use a lossy compression format instead of a lossless one isn‚Äôt, in itself, a problem. The problem is that the photocopiers were degrading the image in a subtle way, in which the compression artifacts weren‚Äôt immediately recognizable. If the photocopier simply produced blurry printouts, everyone would know that they weren‚Äôt accurate reproductions of the originals. What led to problems was the fact that the photocopier was producing numbers that were readable but incorrect; it made the copies seem accurate when they weren‚Äôt.

audiophile,"I wasnt originally sure where to post this so it has been posted to multiple subreddits!

I have a large and growing local music library, all of which are .flac 16bit/44.1khz &amp; 24bit/96khz and it works great to stream via sonos/plex etc across the house however I want offline copies of the songs on my iPhone which is proving difficult. I have tried a couple of different methods so far. 

Essentially I need the ability to sync either via usb or local network as the library is still growing. I dont really want to have to go through album by album, song by song. 

Methods I've tried so far:

\- VLC app on iphone plugged into itunes and manually add each album I want (Got a bit tiresome)

\- foobar2000 using tunefusion allowing me to sync via network however this compressed all my songs

Ideally I want to avoid using itunes to sync locally as there is no way to separate local files from apple music on the phone, also I'd have to convert all songs into ALAC

Any ideas would be much appreciated"

audiophile," Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have this new bluetooth speaker (marshall acton II). I started listening to music and quickly got a neighbor complaint. I believe it was pretty reasonable volume (and time of day), but it seems the complaint is related to vibrations, not the volume.

I would like to have suggestions on how I could improve the situation for my neighbor, without having to reduce the sound too much, completely cut the bass or even stop listening to music...

Regarding the configuration, I have a drywall separation between my unit and my neighbor's. I have installed my speaker against the facing wall, as per the image. There is about 5 meters between the speaker and the separation drywall.

As said, volume is relatively low and the bass levels is at 2 / 10, so pretty low too IMO.

Thanks for the help (and I guess thanks from my neighbor too?)

audiophile,"Hello guys,

Please help me decide, i have been using my technics combo for several years now and its been a great combo amp / preamp, i have from my father since he passed away along side the technics sl-1500 turntable, recently i changed my speakers to Monitor Audio Gold 300 and i‚Äôve been feeling the need to add lamps to my setup to get some different sound, more in the mid‚Äôs, chill the treble a bit etc.

I‚Äôve been looking around and at the price i can afford i found the Vincent tube preamp SA-T7 along side power-amp SP-T700 both with tubes, i heard a lot of people recommend them and that they sound great on my speakers. 

Is it worth it to let go the vintage Technics set in favour of this Vintage set ? Are they build good enough to be a replacement and do the tubs work as they should ? I know its a lot of controversy about tube power-amps so i didn‚Äôt find any info about how the Vincent is build if they have tubes on the input side etc.

Any advice is welcome from people who have more experience on tubs and also know the Technics Class A combo and if its worth to make this change.

Thank you !"

As an example ‚ÄòYou Know What I Mean‚Äô by Jeff Beck.  Drum and Bass lines on 360 lack punch. Jeff‚Äôs guitar sounds like it was funneled through a kazoo.  I stopped after five tracks."

audiophile,"Hello,

I am kind of lost. You see, I understand the concept of analog music: you put a needle on a vinyle, it vibrates, this vibration needs some preamplification in the phono stage, then, travels to an amplifier, which sends the waves to the loudspeaker. The speakers vibrate, push air, and we get music in our ears. That is fine.

But digital!? You stream music, say from Spotify Connect, travels through an inboard DAC, I then play with the Wiim Equalizer with some stupid presets like Lounge, Movie, or Spoken Words (which makes no sense), I suppose it gets converted, but then my Wiim outputs to an external DAC, a Schiit Modi Multibit 2, so I presume that it gets reconverted again, right? Otherwise this DAC would be useless. The DAC converts to analogue, then the signal enters the amps, and the rest is as above.

Worst. You open Audirvana on your computer. You play a CD quality file, then you oversample for the fun of it. Do you? You pass it through some VST stupid stuff, you regret it, than disable the thing. Anyway, your Wiim receives this oversampled signal. What does it do with it? Resample, downsample, let it go through?

This whole thing is a roller coaster. It is quite confusing. No wonder most people just want to push Play, turn the volume up, and listen. Who really cares about Tidal MQA High RES or the never to arrive Spotify Hi-Fi (I am still waiting for Half-Life 3, after more than 10 years)?

Any thoughts?"

audiophile,"I just got my NAD C3050 LE and  pretty disappointed so far. I‚Äôm thinking about returning it but wanted to check with this group first to see if the problem is simply me. I hope it is.

I wanted to check here first to see if anyone else has this unit and what their experience is. Anyone care to share any feedback?

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeing so far‚Ä¶

-	incomplete manual; there are no instructions on how to upgrade the firmware anywhere online or in the print manual. I‚Äôm not even sure there is firmware to upgrade.
-	there doesn‚Äôt seem to be an OSD so there‚Äôs no way to configure it that way. I can‚Äôt get any video output over the hdmi port, at least. 
-	The Dirac Live configuration step to determine the output level only produces test noise when the hdmi cable is connected to my television for some reason.
-	the overall sound output is very, very quiet. I can‚Äôt hear anything until it‚Äôs over 1/3 volume and to get it to a reasonable level I have to run it at 60%-70%. I don‚Äôt really listen loud, so it‚Äôs not from damaged hearing; there just isn‚Äôt any sound at first.
-	the E-ARC hdmi port on the rear doesn‚Äôt turn the unit on and off when the tv (Samsung Q90T) is powered on and off. I had a NAD T758 plugged into the same port previously and it worked flawlessly. I‚Äôve also connected blue sound nodes, Sonos amps, and anthem receivers to the same port and all of those worked too.

And just to reiterate, the hdmi port is plugged into the earc port on my television. It‚Äôs the same port I‚Äôve been using with my T758."
audiophile,"Hello to all the people on this subreddit, this is my first post. :)  
I do not know much about Hi-Fi, but every now and then I look for some new way to enhance my music system (2 Klipsch RP F8000's, 1 Klipsch 15"" Subwoofer, and a Nubert Nuconnect which is an integrated amplifier) and that's when i realise that I have no clue if what I want to do is even possible and if so, how to do it. My amlifier has an integrated EQ but it only has the possibility to change 5 frequencies which for me is not enough so I decided to buy an EQ to pair with my Amplifier. But now I am not sure if that is even possible. I will add a picture that shows the back side of my Amplifier. I would love to know if anyone knows if my receiver has the necessary ports i will need, if i bought an EQ (The EQ i found is the Behringer ULTRAGRAPH PRO FBQ1502HD; [https://www.amazon.de/Behringer-FBQ1502HD-Ultragraph-Graphic-Equalizer/dp/B019Q44E98/ref=cm\_cr\_arp\_d\_product\_top?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.de/Behringer-FBQ1502HD-Ultragraph-Graphic-Equalizer/dp/B019Q44E98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) ).   
Do I need any additional equipment for this to work?   
A friend of mine requested I should buy a DSP and said that he thinks that its not possible for me to connect an EQ to my Amp. I am also not really sure what a DSP really is and how it would solve my problem.

### USB-C to Digital Coaxial Cable Converter

Think this will do the trick?

Apple Music High Res on Pixel 6 Pro --&gt; USB-C Out to Adapter --&gt; Digital Coax out into Digital Coax in of AVR --&gt; Yamaha AVR uses DAC to convert into music.

The only hesitation I have is that this Linksoul website is clearly Chinese, and should this not work out, the restocking and shipping fees would make this into a $50-60 dollar mistake. I have not been able to find anything like this anywhere else, and I'm not allowed to purchase any more expensive gear, lol.

My Yamaha AVR's DAC supports the max rates of Apple Music, and so does this dongle.

audiophile,"Here's the story of my quest for the perfect power amp;

I recently bought an Heaven 11 Billie amp which is a Class D amp paired with a Tube preamp section to replace my old Class A/B 65wpc Sansui A-80. After a week of listening to the Billie, I figured that something was lacking. The presentation was flawless, the power was there but I did not get that wow feeling. I decided to bring back the Sansui to see if I would prefer it. I instantly noticed that the musicality was better. The amp wasn't as precise but the feeling was better. I then remembered a youtube reviewer who said that the star of the show on the Billie was the preamp section, even better than a 4000$ tube preamp he said. So I decided to try out the Billie's pre-section outputed on my old Sansui and TADA. There was my perfect sound. Everything is tighter, the image is larger and more precise and I get back that musicality of my old Sansui BUT because I now have two stages of preamplification I sometimes get an unpleasent hiss at low volumes. I'm pretty sure this is not dangerous for both amps but I would like to get rid of that hiss. The Sansui pre-section cannot be bypassed via a switch. So I tought about finding the right power amp to match the Billie. I've noticed that power amps prices are much higher in general than integrated so I wan't to make sure I get the right match the first time. 

Would you guys have any recommendations of power amps under 1000$ (vintage or not) that are musical with plenty of details? I don't want something too warm, neighter too clinical and neither too neutral. VU meters are a big plus for my liking. I don't even know if such a thing exists, I already have it with my kit but with an unpleasent hiss in the background. 

Other solutions I have thought about are; getting my Sansui's pre-amp section removed by a tech or investing in some power filters like the IFI Ipurifier with an Hospital grade receptacle to make sure that the signal is as pure as possible so there is nothing to boost in the first place.

Please don't be too judgmental about the double pre-amp, I would dare anyone to listen to my kit and tell me that it doesn't sound better the way it is now. 

Kind of lost right now. Looking foward for your recommandations.

Thanks !"

What I like about my system

* Has great physical presence
* Great clarity / sounds crystal-clear
* QSC K8.2s are small (but sound amazing!)  


What I want more of

* More warmth in the midrange
* Lower, tighter lows
* More punch in the upper midrange
* I primarily listen to house music, so I want lows that hit in the 20hz range and highs that articulate up to around 15Khz
* Full Parametric EQ capability"

If not I‚Äôm looking to go powered speakers and pre amp route as it‚Äôs a bit cheaper from what I can tell, I have this (what I thought was a preamp) that was used for my last one but I‚Äôm now seeing it has no rca output. Would I just need a different preamp? Thanks"
audiophile,"I listen to music all the time, literally constantly if im not in school or working im always listening to music. I have a pair of beyerdynamic 770 pros, and samsung galaxy buds 2 pro. I use both for listening, but i most recently got a hiby r3 pro saber from a friend for very cheap. I love the thing and would love to upgrade, i just dont know if its worth it because of how often i use the earbuds. I get the whole hi-res wireless and all but like would it be a waste to upgrade to a $400-$600 dap?"

audiophile,I read that a 3 way system sounds worse then a 2 way system if it comes to big rooms or outdoors. Why is that?
audiophile,"What outputs more watts to the speakers? 
One amp with 200 watt and a crsossover behind it powering a woofer and a tweeter 
or two amps with 100 watt and a highpass behind one to power the tweeter and a lowpass behind the other one to power the woofer? (Max Loudness)
If i get it right both variants would consume the 200 watts but the second version wouldnt be as loud because the amps amplify all frequencys but the highpass sends the lows to ground and the lowpass sends the highs to ground. The crossover sends them to the right speaker so we should have almost 200 watts on woofer and tweeter. Am i right?"
audiophile,"I have a technical question for you. What would be louder/send more watts to the speakers: 1. one amp with 200 watt where i use a crossover two power a woofer and a tweeter; ‚Ä¶or second: 2 amps with 100 watt output where i use a highpass behind one and a lowpass behind the other amp two power tweeter and woofer.
If i get it right the second version wouldnt be as loud because both 100 watt amps amplify the whole frequency range but the highpass sends the low frequencys directly to ground without using it and the lowpass sends the highs to ground. Am i right?"
audiophile,"
Currently using a Onkyo-tx-nr6100. For whatever reason, despite not having any connected, it is preferring the Atmos mix over plain 5.1. I did a sound test and triple checked the back, surround speakers are where they should be.

The next mystery is scrolling through audio modes when Atmos isn't available is that DTS Neural:X is available. Reading about this, if I'm understanding, it's used for upmixing. However the movie I'm watching right now, native 5.1 on a 5.1 system, what is there to upmix?

The Atmos I think I understand, that has a 5.1 'base track' with an x.x.2 sub track for Atmos speakers, so I'm not losing anything but also not gaining anything. However with Atmos I cannot enable THX which is annoying.

Is my AVR bugged? Am I not understanding Neural:X? Is there a reason why my AVR is preferring Atmos? I had a Denon before this and didnt encounter these situations before."

audiophile,"I'm a podcast manager, and my specialty is working with podcasters to make things as simple as possible when recording their podcast. I have a lot of systems in place that my clients like me for for simplifying the process of podcasting. My target audience isn't veteran podcasters or audiophiles or any of that sort. My audience is people who have a wealth of knowledge, but little to no technical abilities to record their podcast episodes.

The reason I mention all of that is because I have spent approximately close to 50 hours searching for a simple, automatic gain control system to control the audio levels on a microphone that I can recommend to my clients

The single most common issue I've ran into is people having the wrong input selected (recording on their laptop microphone by accident). The second, is having their audio levels too hot. Too low is easy, but blown out audio is nearly impossible to repair and recover.

The thing I can't wrap my head around, is why is it that I can purchase nearly any camera (consumer, prosumer, and professional) with XLRs, and they will have an ""auto"" mode for the audio. Any Sony camera with XLR inputs will have an ""auto"" mode for the gain control. But there are *zero* audio interfaces that have this ability. There are some that are *close*, a good example is the Focusrite Vocaster, however that is only a button that you push, and then it sets the audio after you've talked into the mic for a few seconds.

I am looking for an audio interface that *rides* the gain automatically on the gain control for XLR inputs, exactly the same as how any professional broadcast camera has the ability to do so.

I am 100% aware that you can always get better quality audio from knowing how to properly control and set the gain right on an audio interface. But it's an extra thing that I don't want them to worry about, and I know they would prefer not to learn.

There *are* audio recorders (like the Zoom H4 or the Tascam DR40) that have the ability to auto-level as well. However, after using these for 10+ years, I have always found those recorders to be exceptionally difficult to use and setup.

So, currently my only options I am aware of are 

1. Camera with XLR inputs. This is fine if my client is doing a video podcast. I can assist them to set it up as best and easy as possible. However, it's by far the most expensive option costing thousands of dollars.
2. Audio recorder with auto-gain. This is likely more realistic for me I think,  with 2 exceptions: The audio recorder has lots of features that aren't really necessary for me and my use case, and they are quite confusing and difficult to use (simpler ones, like the H6, don't even *offer* auto-gain functionality, which has always felt like taking a step backwards to me).

&amp;#x200B;

What I would love is the simplicity of an audio interface (think Scarlet 2i2) with auto-gain functionality.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm lead to believe there is some technical limitation as to why this does not seem to exist, but if it can be done within professional cameras and audio recorders, why is it not *ever* done within audio interfaces? What would something like this take to develop?

Thanks so much everyone, and if the answer is that it's impossible, what is the reason for this if it can be done on cameras and cheaper audio recorders? Even consumer mics like the Blue Yeti don't have auto-gain functionality that I'm aware of."

audiophile,I love the sound of my LSR305s. The highs being emphasized is something I definitely like in my speakers.

Hello!

I have been plugging away at my hi-fi listening room and am really happy so far except have a painful center of the room low-frequency dip and wondering what I can do about it with regards to speaker positioning. (already spent quite a bit on GIK 244 panels and do intend to get more treatment over time). Note that My dedicated listening position sounds good, but the purpose of such a large room was to be able to dance around a bit, but it sucks that the dead center of the rooms sounds bad.

I am wondering if perhaps my speakers are too far away from the back wall or if perhaps my subwoofers themselves need to be placed elsewhere. Look forward to your help.

Set up:

Room: 37' x 22' x 10.5'

Speakers: Legacy Focus SE with SVS SB16 (x2)

Preamp: Primaluna 400

Amp: Emotiva XPA-DR2

Placement:

Towers are currently positioned at 90"" from back wall (behind speakers) and 44"" from side walls with subs immediately next to he towers on the inside.

My listening position is about 7-10' from the front wall(behind me)."
audiophile,"Ignore the car speaker, but I just moved to my new house, took out this old ass receiver that barley works, hooked up an old subwoofer to it with the cpu battery and an old Sony speaker that I got for 10$ from a thrift store, honestly doesn‚Äôt sound that bad in person"
audiophile,"I'm building a 2.1 system in a small spare bedroom. My use case is primarily music listening, (Apple Music, Spotify, etc) but I will also have the speakers connected to a TV for movie watching.  For various reasons I've got my heart set on the KEF LS50 Meta speakers with an SVS Micro 3000 Sub. Where I'm conflicted is with the source amp/receiver.  I'm leaning towards the NAD C700 because I can connect the TV via eARC and also purely on aesthetics. I'd love any pearls of wisdom or recommendations on something better? My budget for the amp/receiver is $2,500 tops. Music sound quality is important for me."
audiophile,"After going back and forth between Apple Music (love the interface, it's hi-res, but no ""Apple Connect"" like feature), Tidal (love Tidal Connect, ok interface, but not sold on MQA), Qobuz (love that it's all FLAC, hate their user interface), and just straight-up using BluOS with my BluSound Node (the most flexibility, but again, bad user interface) I gave Roon a shot this weekend and I'm loving the interface, the flexibility and customization it offers. It really makes Qobuz so much more usable. I'm on the 14-day trial, but think I'm going to pull the trigger on a full-year subscription while I cancel Tidal and go solely with Qobuz as my streaming source."

audiophile,"[My room ](https://i.imgur.com/ZGbUXdT.jpg)

I've decided I'd like to have a go at some room treatment. My first step will be to get some panels for the first reflection points to the left and right of my speakers.

The room is a bit odd shaped, with my setup more or less in a 10' triangle. Behind me is about 15' of open space and to the right the wall cuts off to another open area.

Speakers are Cornwall IV's with a REL HT1205 12"" sub. Room is drywall with carpet floors. Lots of shelves, furniture and other stuff around. 

Firstly what should I get? Absorber or diffuser panels? What's size should they be? Length and width? Thickeness?

I am also located in Canada, so I would ideally like something I can buy here.

Are there cheap/easy DIY options?

audiophile,"Hello, I was thinking about this for a while so I hope to get some insight on this here.
Suppose I have a lossless audio file say 1200kbps and we convert it into any of the lossy formats ( yes lossless to lossy again smite me XD).
We get at 320kbps an mp3 an aac an ogg and an opus (cuz why the hell not lol) file.
Now also assuming we have top of the line Godzilla level hardware to listen to them on, would it be possible to hear any differences between them? 
Since all of them are at 320kbps they should sound the same since audio ‚Äúquality‚Äù depends on the bitrate irrespective of the format or encoding correct?
Basically what I am trying to see how much of an effect (if any at all) does formats have on the conversion if the bitrate is the same."

audiophile,"Howdy folks,

New to this sub so sorry if this isn‚Äôt the best place to ask.

I‚Äôve lately become more and more aware of a weird output from my stereo system. There is intermittently a buzz coming out of my stereo, usually when there is audio being sent to it. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is not a ground loop because of how it behaves.

For example, let‚Äôs say I am playing music on Spotify. When the audio is coming through but at a very low volume (say, a pause between lines) you can hear the buzz distinctly. Then, when you pause, the buzz is gone. But, say you are playing music and set the volume to 0, then you can hear the buzz. It does not change when volume is increased or decreased.

Today though, I discovered that even if I change to different inputs on the receiver, the buzz is still present when no cords are plugged in at all. 

I just did a quick frequency analysis and there are four frequencies being played at a very low volume. These appear roughly to be .75, 1.5, 2.25, and 3 kHz. It sounds like a sawtooth wave.

Any help troubleshooting is super appreciated!"
audiophile,"Using a O2/ODAC, I have an issue with my new computer I never had with the old one with Win 10. New PC is on Win 11.

When the USB is plugged any any USB port in the back of the computer, and playing games, sometimes the audio will pop and then eventually cut out. It makes that USB port useless for a while (seems to recover after some time strangely). If I switch it to another port in the back same thing will happen (tried 3-4 different ports back there and tried different USB cables and made sure there was space in the back for heat to dissipate). 

What eventually worked was plugging it into the front Case USB port.. no issues whatsoever.. Only thing is the usb port is on top of the case and it looks ugly having a wire going up there permanently.. I'm considering buying an SPDIF Optical to USB converter to feed data to the ODAC so I can keep the wiring at the back of the PC, but I have no idea what effect that will have on audio quality. Anyone know if this would work and if I would I notice a difference in sound quality?

audiophile,"I currently switched my setup, which had a bunch of separates which included an ifi zen phono preamp. I have seen measurements on both and I feel like I partially understand what I see.

I've tested both sounds swapping back and forth for maybe half an hour.... with two young kids running around screaming... so not the most ideal critical listening situation.

During ""all due respect"" on rtj2 I feel there are some pretty articulate sounds happening and when swapping back and forth I felt like the ifi zen kept up and kept the sounds crisp while the nap kinda blurred the sounds in the gun shots and quick hitting bass.

If anyone knows better about any measurements posted on asr or wherever please let me know if they confirm what I'm hearing? And how to tell?"

audiophile,"So my reviver has a phono ground - but my ground cable is not long enough to reach it- I am really not wanting to spend 50$ on a ground cable just so it can be a few extra inches longer than mine - I also really don‚Äôt want to love everything around! 

I know the cable can be grounded by being taped to the metal receiver or by being attached to an active speaker (both of these are not options) have and of you guys had success with any of the other options? Or should I consider them void and just buy the longer ground?"
audiophile,"New to this sub. I've had the same receiver for over 20 years, which was a hand-me-down from my father. It's a Sony STR-D915. Has served me well despite years of abuse (on for many hours, high volume playing, etc.).

The rest of my setup is:

Turntable: Technics SL-D1 w/ Shure SC35C cart

Speakers: Boston Acoustics T-1000

PC connected via M-Audio Audiophile 24/96 soundcard w/ RCA outputs

I may not be a real audiophile, but generally I am extremely happy with the setup. I listen to everything from classical guitar to Aphex Twin. 

If I wanted to start upgrading the system, which of the 3 routes would make most sense?

1. Upgrade to separate phono preamp. I love tube sound and wanted to go with a tube phono stage.
2. Upgrade to higher end turntable tonearm/cart
3. Replace receiver with discrete power amp / preamp"
audiophile,"Okay so I love balanced sounds speakers that fill rooms and high fidelity. I‚Äôve been in this sub for a min looking at these setups with awe and I want to get into it more, at least in the technical/research side (since I‚Äôm not financially stable enough to just go buy stuff right now) any advice on people/websites that will give me comparisons,  recommendations and advice? Preferably someone who is trustworthy and maybe a beginners space? Any form of informational media for it honestly. Maybe a YouTuber recommendation or an unbiased website?

audiophile,"I originally posted the k2 on here not long ago but have upgraded again due to it being faulty. 

Upgraded to the Roksan k3 and yes it seems to have great potential and has great control especially bass, wow.

However every where I see it's supposed to be inbetween warm or neutral sounding and not harsh. For me it's true at lower volumes but once turned up my tweeters become harsh especially the hi hats or anything with fast precusive instruments and so on, sometimes voices to. 

Is it speakers or do I need a streamer instead of Bluetooth, would any of these stop the harsh characteristics at louder volumes. Currently using mordaunt short aviano 2.

FYI it looks much better in person:)"
audiophile,"I've been producing and mixing electronic music for a while now and just started investing more into my equipment and studio space. A new audio interface, couple pairs of reference headphones, acoustic treatment for the room, a few new mics, a ton of plugins and more small miscellaneous stuff. I've been wanting to upgrade my current studio monitors (JBL LSR 308) for a while but wanted to make sure my room was at least decently treated first. I do most of my mixing on headphones and feel like it works well, but I do plan to start doing mixing as a service and would like my space to be set up for clients. 

I told a family member about my setup and they gave me these older  JBL LSR 28P monitors they had. One of the tweeters seems to be kind of shot and there is a dent in the woofer of that same one, but the other monitor seems to be fine. I don't really know too much about speakers so I don't really know if these are worth getting fixed up and using as my studio's monitors until I can afford to invest in some higher end ones. I feel like I only really have a few options here: 1. try and sell them as is, 2. get them fixed and use them or 3. get them fixed and try and sell them, use the money to get something else. Like I said I don't really know speakers much so if anyone has any input let me know."

audiophile,"I am trying to learn, obviously.

I have an integrated amp and a Technics 1200 turntable. I play records mostly but am going to buy a streamer soon. I bought an inexpensive tube phono pre-amp and I think it helped the sound. But then I got to thinking: if the amp is integrated and the turntable has a phono pre amp built in, isn‚Äôt the signal from the record being pre-amped twice, and now a third time with my new tube phono pre-amp, before going to the amplifier? Is this a correct understanding? Does the phono pre-amp I just bought and that I think improves the sound really do anything?

I was thinking of buying a decent phono pre-amp next but don‚Äôt want to waste money on something that is doing nothing.

Can someone clear up the idea(s) for me?

Thanks.

Amp: Denon PME 600ne

Last July I had a fleeting thought to overhaul my system. I‚Äôve always been a fan of the Ojas speakers and how they sound. I don‚Äôt have extensive audio knowledge, and I started this project as a complete novice. After 6 months of research to understand better how audio and speakers work, I decided we could build our own speakers and upgrade the system, and learn a ton along the way. 

The setup makes me want to sit down and listen to music every day, leaps and bounds beyond my previous system, but the time and learning with my pops in the woodshop was the real cherry on top for me here. Getting to build something beautiful and have those memories. 

Happy listening, y‚Äôall.

audiophile,"If you're like me you might love the idea of having a sound system that costs more than your entire net worth but the sad reality is that money is tight for many of us.

Recently I decided that I deserve better than the tinny mids that came from my TVs built in speakers but when looking for inspiration on this sub I was disappointed with what I saw. 

I understand that this is a sub for high quality audio and I understand that ""good"" audio isn't cheap. With that said I was still disheartened by the attitude here that you essentially have to spend a minimum of $200 for speakers and if you can't afford that then you should feel bad and go fuck yourself.

Despite this, I eventually took a gamble on a ¬£30 set of 2.0 desktop speakers called the Creative Pebble V3. I hesitantly placed the order and anxiously awaited the arrival of my crime against eardrums.

They arrived the next day, I got them set up and plugged into my PC. I loaded up Spotify, preparing my ears for the worst, and finally summoned the courage to click play.

I was shocked at what I heard. I couldn't believe how much better they sounded compared to the built in audio I was familiar with. Not only did the mids sound far cleaner than before, but I was surprised to hear a notable amount of bass and top end too. These sub-entry level speakers brought a whole new dimension to the audio from my music, shows, and games. 

Before you rip out your gold lined power cables to garrote me, please understand that this post isn't for the audiophiles with a sound system worth more than all my organs combined. I know that proper audiophile gear has infinitely richer bass and profoundly crisp top end, but that isn't something I'll be able to afford for a long time.

This post is for the people that are in my position, the people that have to choose between food and heating while waiting for payday. The Creative Pebble V3s obviously don't hold a candle to anything you see on this subreddit, but to me they were still a big improvement and I'm so happy that I took the risk.

One day I will also have fridge sized speakers and a continent rattling subwoofer made by a company with a German sounding name that I can't pronounce properly, but until then I'm happy with the massive improvement to my quality of listening.

If the best speakers you currently have are the ones in your phone, monitor, or TV, then I want you to know that you can still enjoy vastly better audio without draining your inflation-crippled bank account.

This post will be useless to many of you, but I hope I've given my fellow broke ear-having peasants the confidence to take the first small step on your audiophile journey."

My Example:
-Marantz Cinema 60: 
8 ohm, 20 Hz - 20 kHz, 0.08% 2ch rates 100 W
-Arcam AVR20: 
8 ohm, 20 Hz - 20 kHz, 0.02%  2ch rates 110 W.

If double the wattage adds 3db, the 10% difference in wattage should only be .30db variance right?  But if you switch between the two, the arcam is undeniably louder.  I've never measured this, but I do it every day and it is a considerable difference, certainly more than .30db."

audiophile,"Have had the JBL Studio 580s in the house for several months now and wanted to give back to the sub as I've not seen many in-room measurements to go with the feedback from owners.

Speaker rear is 20"" from front wall, 9' from nearest side wall, microphone and seat are 10' away. Speaker is toed out ~15 degrees. Room is 20' wide and 40' long, ceiling height of 7' 8"". Low pile carpet on standard 3M pad over concrete floor with drywall construction for walls.

Here's the link to the Imgur gallery of measurements. [https://imgur.com/a/10Ag9Bc](https://imgur.com/a/10Ag9Bc)

Pros:

Easy to listen to, takes no effort to hear the individual sounds or to visualize the sound stage. Reproduces the natural tones of singers and instruments. Appropriate amount of jump for transients, not pulling power on louder impacts and doesn't add extra oomph either. Renders proper scale as well, things are just there, hanging in space between the speakers. Great detail retrieval and provides the appropriate amount of room sounds, if in the recording. Sounds the same at quiet SPLs and at levels louder than my ears can stand. Bass power is right where you'd want it to be, kick drum in the chest feeling is possible from 80WPC AVR.

Cons:

Treble is shelved up from 3KHz on up by 3-5dB if fired straight at ears. Some grittiness or 'extra' stuff going on in the treble when setup firing straight into the ears. Backsplash from the compression tweeter? Shows off crappy files or compressed files but doesn't make things unlistenable. Solo male voice panned into one speaker spans a slightly outsized space due to space between tweeter and top mid/woofer. This isn't noticeable on non-hard panned voices, i.e. normal program material male singers are the appropriate size. I understand now why Studio 590 reviews mention this is a problem in those larger speakers. This 580 design is probably the upper limit in this regard.

Bought them on sale for $300 each delivered which makes them a screaming bargain. At regular pricing I'd hesitate on the purchase. These outclass the Heresy IIIs and Wharfedale Diamond 10.4s in the same, rather large space for smoothness and ease of listening. Running a sub with the Klipsch and Wharfedale speakers doesn't save the day either. The Heresies do this different kind of hyper-realism that can be intrusive where the 580s don't go overboard in this regard.

The JBL Studio 580s have been quite the pleasant surprise. They do exactly what I was looking for, making enjoyable music that is of one piece, covers the frequency range of the music I listen to, and do not need a sub. I am so happy I took the gamble on these, even with JBL's free return program. Oh, the styling you ask? Is not as ridiculous, 2001 Space Oddity-looking, as we thought they might be. Any niggles over their monolith-looking styling goes right out the door once the music starts playing."
audiophile,Can anyone send me a image of a Kenwood p38 manual or the insides of one as I have broke mine and the parts have fallen out
audiophile,"Hello there,
I recently bought this record (Kali Malone's ""Does Spring Hide Its Joy"") and the first few grooves have this pop (or tick) sound. See [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/629jytw1tl7k8yy/IMG_7145.MOV?dl=0). Of course, I doubled wiped the record with the anti-dust, and checked the stylus... The pop is always at the same spot. This, to me, means it is part of the record (bad pressing? scratch at the manufacturing place?).

The record store will exchange it, so no issue there. But, I have had the same issue on another record. So my question is: is there more sloppy record pressings than ""in the past""? Is it a pressing issue?"
audiophile,"I just switched my broken amp to an audiolab 6000A and of course now, two days after the purchase my trusted CD player died too. 

So now I was thinking about two possibilities. One was to just buy a cheap (but decent) CD player with Toslink and connect it to the amp that has quite a good DAC. Otherwise I could get a CD player and connect it either with coax or Toslink. 

I was reading that it's better to just get a good CD player and connect it with Toslink. Though no reasons are given.

Now my computer mind tells me that if I have a digital output from a CD Reader technically a 1000 euros CD player works exactly the same as a 100 euros one, they both should work like a computer transmitting 0s and 1s and no sound manipulation in between. 

But I guess that if there are 2500 euros CD players with Toslink they must be different from a 100 euros one.

audiophile,"I've been shopping for a new HiFi system (I went to OMA in DUMBO yesterday and it was definitely a peak experience!). 

I notice that within the first few minutes of listening to an excellent system my ears love what they hear.  But after listening for awhile, the 'wow' factor falls off a bit and the vividness of the music begins to normalize.  Question:  Is this a real thing that others experience?  Or is it particular to my ears and/or mind?"
audiophile,"I recently switched to Apple Music lossless streaming after listening to Spotify for as long as it existed basically and I‚Äôm so excited about it. For me music is 90% about the feeling and flow of it. With lossless this just becomes so much more smooth and enjoyable and tracks I got bored of are amazing again.

I must say Spotify does a lot of stuff right and if they finally add lossless themselves (which they promised they would in 2021) I would immediately go back. So if you don‚Äôt want to switch because of their features I have a tip for you that will improve the sound quality. Go to settings and turn off audio normalization. You would think this only does what it says and changes the volume but there is some internal processing that degrades the sound quality by a lot. Turning it off will make volume fluctuate more but it will increase quality."

They are a huge upgrade to my creative PC speakers and I am extremely satisfied with the sound, however today I picked up on a slight problem while listening to Drum and Bass. On low frequencies (more specifically 40-50hz) the left speaker has a slight rattle. It can't be heard that much from afar, but when I am close I can hear it slightly. I tried softly pressing the woofer and for a few seconds it went away before rattling again. Is this something that can be fixed?

##### #09 Can the TDAI-1120 be used as a RoomPerfect processor?

Yes, the TDAI-1120 can be used as a RoomPerfect processor by disabling the main speaker‚Äôs power amp stages in the setup menu. However, the RoomPerfect-optimized signal is only available at the TDAI-1120‚Äôs analog pre-out, while the TDAI-3400 and TDAI-2170 have a digital output to use them as a purely digital RoomPerfect processor.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to test something, what I have in mind is to use the 1120 as a streamer/DAC and RoomPerfect processor for my Hegel, connect analog OUT 1120 to the analog IN of a Hegel Integrated Amp and run **RoomPerfect Calibration**. Amplification and driving the speakers will be done by the Hegel.

I need some help with settings, can anyone advise?

* Line out / sub speakers -&gt; Advanced?

audiophile,"I recently got a 5.1 system installed(yay).

But when I tried to play anything on it, any sound that would come out of either the FRONT LEFT or REAR LEFT speaker was about 20 Times as quiet as the other 3 satellites ,(I realize now that this is because of a faulty DTS dac )

But I thought it may be because of a bad audio driver so I installed the newest Realtek driver.

But since that I can't get any sound from the 3.5 jack to function correctly no matter what driver I install (sadly I was unable to roll back the driver I had previously).

I have tried multiple drivers but I keep running into the same 2 problems every time.

Either A) it doesn't recognizes that anything is plugged in(no headphone option in sound control panel) and it just play the sound both through the built in speakers and the headphone jack.

Or B) It recognizes the headphones but the sound it plays through it is ""bit crushed"" and crackly to the point where you can't even make out anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tested both with a pair of headphones and the 5.1 speakers multiple times. The sound worked with both before the driver reinstall, so im certain thats the thing at fault here. But I can't find any working solutions on google or reddit, so I thought i'd ask the smart audio people in here.

audiophile,"Now I know I might get a lot of hate for this, but I honestly think tapes sound better than CDs. Now I know tapes degrade and CDs don‚Äôt, and I will admit when a cassette is worn out it sounds terrible. But recently I bought some standard equipment, a regular chunky CD player and a equally chunky cassette player. Both devices are functionally the same sound wise, but I still notice a difference. CDs capture music perfectly fine, but I‚Äôve noticed compared to cassette they seem a bit more sterile. The sound is not as expressive as something you would find on vinyl. But if you get a good quality cassette, the sound is very open, and more comparable to vinyl. And I swear the bass on tracks sounds better on cassettes compared to CDs. My personal opinion, but if you‚Äôre a true collector and you want to listen to a song as if it were on vinyl but can‚Äôt afford the vinyl, get the cassette of it!! Right equipment and good tapes = amazing sound. I only write this post because I keep seeing massive hate for cassettes, with people saying there‚Äôs basically no point in getting them.

audiophile,"Hello, I'm gonna try to keep this as short as I can. I'm kind of newbie so here it goes: I have a couple of speakers (old paradigm titans v1) that I use with a SMSL sa300. I should consider upgrading but i wanna add a subwoofer for the moment, this is for the speakers that I use at my PC, and the objective is for music only, don't really care about the sound in movies and other stuff. The room that I am right now is a little weird: not too small but i can't  separate the desk (or speakers) from the wall. When i listen to music only I move them and myself a little but it's not ideal, and too close to the wall this speakers bass get super boomy. I will try to add some mineral wool behind the desk but not right now.  


Te questions:  
1) As far as I understand if I use something like the MiniDSP 2x4 HD, that thing will ""separate"" the low frecuencies, sending those to the subwoofer and not making the speakers reproduce them, thus, aliviating the problem of the wall proximity a little (i would be putting the subwoofer in the air as away as I can from the wall up of my head). Is this thing i'm saying correct? If that is the case what product do you recommend? I'm a little scared of the MiniDSP 2x4 HD because of some comments of noise. I was also considering the ROLLS SX95 (not a DSP unit, don't mind). The last thing i was considering is the MiniDSP Flex, but that one is a little pricey (i would still consider it if it is the only option).

2) The SMSL SA300 does have a subwoofer output but no crossover controls, as far as I understand that means that if I connect the subwoofer to it the speakers will still be reproducing the low frecuencies, right?  


3) As I said before I don't really mind if i have no DSP, I have a microphone and i believe that I can just do some room correction with equalizer APO or another software, or is this statement sacrilegious or something?  


The subwoofer I was considering is the REL Acoustics T/5x or T/7x. Thank you

audiophile,"Hi everyone! Hoping one of your might be able to share some wisdom.. 

I have been playing around with the MINIDSP and correcting my room with DIRAC. 

Im trying to match my frequency response to a +10dB Harman curve, but with a level matched sub and mains, I am finding that I have to boost quite a fair bit at the lower frequencies in order to match the target curve. Instead of level matching my sub and mains at 75dB, I've instead increased the volume on my sub to 85dB before running DIRAC, thereby naturally achieving a frequency response that more closely resembles the bass boosted Harman curve. I try to boost it such that the majority of the bass frequencies lie above the target curve, so with DIRAC applied, the frequencies get cut instead of boosted. 

Is this the wrong approach to be taking?"

audiophile,"Hello all,

I'm finally stepping a foot into the upper level of audio this year, but I'm a complete newbie when it comes to the specifics.

I've had my eyes on the purple th900 mk2s for over a year, and am finally looking to pull the trigger.

But until now I've really only used plain 3.5mm jack and Bluetooth headphones for my pc.

I'm curious what exactly I need as far as an amp and dac setup for these headphones, and maybe some reccomendations from those that have experience with them.

I am hoping to get somwthing serviceable for 500-1000, and from what I've read, the mk2s have a nice V shape, bass and treble heavy signature, which is perfect for me as I listen primarily to edm/electro.

Any suggestions?

And how does a dac/amp typically hook up to a pc? I understand the pc hooks into the dac/amp and then you plug your cans into that, but that's all I know."

This is my first audio set up and I‚Äôm planning on purchasing a DAC soon. However, in the mean time, I max the volume on my iPad and use the knob on the amp to control volume. As an experiment, I plugged the 3.5mm into my TV and played Spotify from there; at 20% volume from the TV and the same volume knob position on the amp, the sound was much louder.

1) Is there any danger to the amp or speakers by raising the volume on the TV?
2) Will I get better sound quality out of the TV than the iPad
3) Does my question have anything to do with gain vs. volume?

ChatGPT: Vinyl and digital are both viable audio formats, and the superiority of one over the other is a matter of personal preference.

Neither format is objectively better, but rather each has its own advantages and disadvantages."

audiophile,"Hi everyone,

Here is my situation and where I stand: 

I have one room, fairly big, for my home theater and music listening. At the moment, my only amp is a 10 year old Denon AVR-2313 CI, and to be honest, the sound if quite good, even at high levels, when listening to music. It clips every now and then, when I listen to 80db level, but that is not the question here. This AVR does not have any front pre-outs. Therefore, I cannot use it in conjunction with the next amp I will purchase (I have not made up my mind yet) with HT bypass for speaker sharing.

I was looking to, maybe, upgrade my AVR with pre-outs, buy they are quite expensive, usually above 1500$ CAD, and I have no intention of spending money on HT. Frankly, I have a 5.1 setup, and it is plenty good enough for the crappy movies we find on Netflix or Amazon Prime.

Therefore, instead of spending this money on an AVR, I was thinking about spending it on another pair of speakers/stands/cables. But these new speakers would be installed just beside my main floorstanding loudspeakers.

Does it make sense? Would two (pairs) speakers side by side affect the sound of one pair, or both, regarding spacing? What are your thoughts on the subject?

Thanks

My question is how can I store all these mp3 files? BTW, I'm only 15 and a noob at all this stuff so I'm not going to go buy the most expensive equipment or anything. I was thinking of these things:

1. Burning the albums to cds. I don't know if they would be a very good solution though because they do wear out quick and I'm not going to go buy the really expensive ones but they are really nice and easy to pick and play something quick.
2. A lot of people suggested storing it on a usb drive. That would be fine considering how cheap and easy they are, but they are a pain to select an album or song to play on a small screen on a mini hifi system from my experience.
3. I was also considering an external HDD or SSD drive, but same with the usb, they can be pretty unintuitive picking a song or album to play.

So what do you think is the best way to store albums and music long term. I will still be playing all the songs and adding new ones as well. What do you think is the most cost efficient?"

audiophile,"Hi everyone,

This is my first post in r/audiophile and I‚Äòm a little intimidated when I see all of your incredible setups. 

I recently decided to finally upgrade my worn out garage sale record player and, after doing some research, quickly realised the internet raised more questions than answers. 

My simple setup is as follows: 

- Pioneer A-656 Mark II Stereo Amp 

- 2 x Grundig BX-1000 speakers

- P-70 direct drive turntable

I‚Äòm quite happy with the amp and the speakers, the volume is more than sufficient and the sound is clear and warm. The turntable and pickup definitely need replacement and that is where my question lies.

What would be a good piece in the sub-500‚Ç¨ segment for my setup?

The first record player I came across was the ProJect Debut 3 and I very much enjoyed what I was reading, but I dislike the manual, buttonless speed change and lack of pitch control. It‚Äòs a bit too minimal for me.

Then I found the Audiotechnica AT-LP120XBT-USB (yeah, it‚Äòs a mouthful) and I love the USB recording capability, the classic Technics look, and the functionality, but I‚Äòm not entirely sure how the built in phono stage will interact with my amp. I‚Äòd like to avoid using any preamp stuff and just plug the phono directly into my system. Is that possible with this player?

What does a phono stage mean for my system, is it worth using the record players or should I rely on the Pioneers, can I circumvent the built in phono on these more modern turntables somehow?

Any advice would be amazing and if anyone knows of a nice turntable that I haven‚Äòt found yet that is within my price range and works well with an older hifi system I would be very grateful of any recommendations. Ideally direct drive with speed and pitch control, USB recording is a plus, and good dampening.

Thank you!"
audiophile,"Just heard about this from a friend who claims it ‚Äúsounds better‚Äù but won‚Äôt explain why. 

I don‚Äôt see how you‚Äôd get better sound, since you can‚Äôt add sound that doesn‚Äôt exist in the source file. 

Is it some kind of AI upscaling, where approximations are inserted in-between each original data point? I know i‚Äôve seen that done for videos. 

Only other thing I can think of is that more data points could somehow force a DAC to convert raw data more accurately. Kind of like how 300fps on a 200hz monitor is technically more accurate than 200fps."
audiophile,"My wife and I are doing light housework and making a queue on Spotify. What do people without music do? 

If I am awake, chances are there is music playing. Pop, rock, funk, alt, disco, old metal, new indie stuff... always."
audiophile,I'm helping out a friend with their car audio setup. The system sounds great at low to medium volumes but my friend insists on basically turning it up as loud as it'll get. It ends up distorting quite a bit because his audio files are from CDs. I find it incredibly evident that he's using compressed audio. Would a lossless format solve this problem? It's a 2400w system the speaker's aren't even close to maxed out so I know that's not the problem. I listen to my music incredibly loud and don't notice much distortion when I listen to FLAC files even above 100 decibels. It seems to me that higher bitrate allows music to be turned up louder without distortion. MP3s seem to be missing a lot of definition. Thoughts?
audiophile,"I‚Äôm looking at purchasing a pair of KEF LSX IIs for placement on my desktop and am trying to determine the appropriate type of stands.

audiophile,I got the Timeless recently and found myself having to lower the bass by half with EQ but now I'm having issues with sibilance. I use it straight from my phone's headphone jack and the bass doesn't sound as overwhelming on my PC (through my E-MU). It may just be the songs I'm playing as well. Does anyone have any suggestions or a song to test for sibilance? I find some vocals to be too sibilant but some are fine. Thanks a ton
audiophile,I am experimenting with some of my first DAC‚Äôs after using analogue forever. I am getting a Chord Hugo TT 2 to plug into my Chord Prima preamp. I was wondering what the best way to connect my phone (iPhone 11 pro) to the preamp would be. If there is some sort of quality lightning to RCA cable that will match the capabilities of these pieces.

Frankly, I think Genelec is the right speaker but I can get the S2‚Äôs for about half the Genelecs.  Obviously I‚Äôd need stands and an amp to drive the S2‚Äôs, so that figures into the calculations, but I can buy the S2‚Äôs, build up the mad-money fund again, and buy those over time.  Am I on the right track with Genelec, or can I make the S2‚Äôs work well in my space?  I‚Äôd need to move pretty quickly to get the S2‚Äôs.  The Genelecs I can buy at any time."

We find for this song a stereo Hi-Res version in 24 bits 44.1 kHz and the Dolby Atmos version.

The comparison of the waveforms below between the stereo version and Dolby Atmos Binaural shows the effect of the dynamic range compression on the stereo version with the suppression of some peaks:

https://preview.redd.it/moqed3khrufa1.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=300b9c1688df95adbb160ffd8d1ce0a22785eeb2

This is confirmed with the Dynamic Range measurement, DR11 for the Binaural version and DR8 for the stereo version. It is a pity that the stereo version is limited in dynamics whereas the album ""[Acoustic Album No. 8](https://magicvinyldigital.net/2021/12/11/katie-melua-acoustic-album-no-8-review-cd-streaming-qobuz-tidal/)"" had no limitation with its DR14.

When listening, the stereo version lacks precision and detail in the areas impacted by the limiter. The binaural Atmos version offers a better rendering of voices and more openness, but with a slightly attenuated bass.

Even if our systems are rather in stereo, it is interesting to see the evolution of the rendering on an Atmos system. 

The Atmos version decoded in 7.1.4 brings an opening of the sound scene and a beautiful presence of the voice with a mix, and favors the opening of the sound scene in front and on the sides in coherence with the style of music as shown in the distribution below :

audiophile,"Hello! I am recently moving into my first apartment after graduating uni and I really want to set up a HiFi music listening system but I'm confused on the required equipment or have some questions about my needs and wants that I can't exactly figure out on my own.

So I want to buy a pair of  Wharfedale Linton Speakers because I abosolutely love the look, the stands, and they do stretch my budget but I think that's fine if I can get a set of bookshelf speakers that will last me a very very long time and I can enjoy it for a very very long time. That is what I'm trying to focus my set up around I guess (I like the JBL Synthesis L100s or the KLH model 5s too!).

**First Question:** Should I purchase a subwoofer with this set and if so what would you guys recommend that match the aesthetics. I want my living room to be a cohesive walnut wood/warm aesthetic. (I heard you can buy a walnut vinyl to make systems match so maybe it's not that important)

**Second Question:** Are there any bookshelf speakers that is recommended for someone who is first starting out where they give a classic wood ""retro"" and is priced less than the Lintons? (I listen to a lot of different genres which is why I heard the Lintons are good but I do mostly listen to Hip-hop, indie alternative, rock, EDM, and classical)

I also want to add I'm a bit confused on the role of a music streamer. My goal is to make this HiFi system a living room entertainment system. My goal is to have a TV (playing Spotify via Roku or Chromecast) and a turntable as sources and then bookshelf speakers and a subwoofer if needed (even though I like movies and shows, I don't really care for a surround sound system because the wiring and all seems so difficult and not worth it for me). This leads me to 

**Third Question:** Do I need a music streamer if I mostly want to stream Spotify from my phone to my TV  and then play my music through my speakers? I don't think I'm obsessive or a perfectionist to dial into hi-res audio files (I do care about gapless playback though) so Spotify or maybe Tidal lossless would do me just fine for me. What's also kind of important to me is being able to stream the visual part of the album to my TV - meaning I really love to see the album art on my TV screen while the music is playing. I know you can get a music streamer to bypass the TV and play straight to the speakers but I really enjoy having the artwork displayed largly while I listen. 

**Fourth Question:** Would I need a DAC in my system if I'm going from TV to Amp to Speaker? I'm planning on doing the streaming from Chromecast or Roku but I believe they're like the same thing when it comes to source quality (please correct me if I'm wrong!)

**Fifth Question:** Are there any gaps or suggestions or criticisms or product recommendations you guys have for you me and my goal set up? As much as I love music and the artform, I'm trying not to get crazy obsessive because to me it seems like diminishing returns after good speakers and amps and turntables. I could be completely wrong and am still trying to figure it all out so please tell me! I'd love to talk about potential set ups, better performing or priced speakers, all of that. I'm here to learn :)

**TL;DR:** Newbie questions that pertain to if Wharfedale Lintons need a subwoofer in an apt living room,  better priced to performance speakers, do I need a music streamer, is a DAC necessary in my system, and if there's any other recommendations or suggestions you recommend I should know or consider."

audiophile,"Hellooo,

Does anyone know of an app on your pc that you can download to allow you to manually mix the sound coming from different computer apps/programs? 

For example, if I play a song on Spotify, my web browser and the media player on my pc at the same time, is there a program that can allow you to mix those sounds to your taste?

Apologies if I explained that poorly. In very simple terms I'm looking for advanced volume control across different apps on my pc.

I'm happy to accompany this with external hardware if required e.g. small mixing deck.

Thanks"
audiophile,"Any 8mm set up that can accommodate this? Any other options? I happen to be sitting on a massive 8mm cable I could use, but I‚Äôm worried about static from computer, and not sure the best option to split the sound so I can get the same audio going to multiple speakers from different 8mm wires

Goal: I want to set up home audio for my 2bdr apt so I don‚Äôt have to wear headphones walking around the house like an idiot. Mainly for podcasts and light music. Not sure what speakers I‚Äôll use; but to be clear this is not for fancy or expensive set up, more just to have a set up. Not going wired for quality purposes, I just prefer wired everything including internet and I‚Äôm not going to unstubborn myself on that now."
audiophile,"I own a Korg Koasillator (Synthesizer) and my current setup is just hooking it up to my amplifier which goes to my speakers. This works fine if I just want to listen to the sound but I also want to be able to record at the same time. This is when I run into problems. It I hook the synthesizer up to my amplifier and then use the headphone output into my audio interface, which goes into my computer, it will record just fine but no sound comes out of my speakers. I would like to use my speakers that are connected to the amp while simultaneously recording using my audio interface. What are my options? Thank you."
audiophile,"So, from my iPhone, I want to be able to listen to my headphones (B&amp;W Px8) that, when wired (USB-C in), utilizes an internal DAC supporting 24-bit/48kHz playback. Thing is, I can‚Äôt use a lightning to USB-C since it draws too much power from my phone, charging my headphones.

So what are my alternatives here? The lightning to 3.5mm has a DAC claiming to support up to 24/48, would there be significant losses from the internal DAC of the headphones converting the signal again? Should I go for an off-brand dongle that support higher than 24/48 or does it make any difference?

Does anyone have experience with this or knowledge on effects of double DACing? 

Any suggestions on how to achieve a digital out signal from my phone without charging my headphones?

Now these cans sound fantastic in Bluetooth mode but even better when I plug them in to my computer, so I‚Äôd fancy the option to have any use of my Tidal HiFi subscription afk as well.

Thanks in advance."
audiophile,"I know nothing about Blu Ray Players and recently purchased a Panasonic UB820-K Player with a question as to whether I could use an HDMI splitter to connect two 2.1 cables out from it ‚Äî one into an HDMI port of my LG OLED TV, and the other, into a 4k Apple TV device, as the eArc port on the tv already has a SONOS Arc connected to it with two of the remaining three ports accidentally pushed inside of it, leaving only one port available, hence my desire to use the splitter.

audiophile,"Hi all.

After upgrading my old Bose bookshelf speakers with Mordaunt-Short Avant 906i tower speakers, I would like to make a next upgrade to my system.

I'm doubting between :
- a new (second hand) amplifier in place of my Onkyo TX-8020

Or 

- replacing the standard MM element that came with my new Denon DP-400 with an Audio Techica VM-95 MC element.

My budget is around 250 euros. The element is around 160 euros I believe. I don't really know what second hand amp I can get for that money.

What would improve my audio the most, you say? Any thoughts?

audiophile,"Ok so, a couple years ago I bought the xm3s, after looking at many reviews saying they were the best thing since sliced bread, I figured they'd be a safe bet with their NC and stable BT connection.
I've gotten much enjoyment out of them, they sound decent for the genres I listen to, but I've found them lacking in their soundstage, and I'm now chasing that feeling like you're in the room with artist.
I've heard the 650's (and 600's) sound neutral and ""intimate"", like the vocals are right next to your head, and it feels like the kind of experience I'm looking for. 
I'm not bothered about portability, I have my xm3s and IEMs for train and plane journeys, but now I find myself looking for critical listening headphones, ones I can mute my tv, play a braindead game and just enjoy the musical experience, the feeling of having my own private concert.

Before I pull the trigger on anything, I thought I'd ask your guys experienced opinions, as I'm aware now of blindly believing the hype that content creators are so gleefully feeding us. 

Would the move to the open backed hd650's (found a pair for ¬£100 on ebay) give me what I'm looking for, or would it be best to stick to what I've got, maybe save up and get a different pair later down the line?

I've also researched some decent dac/amps to power a pair of headphones like this, but any recommendations would also be appreciated.

Tl;Dr is it worth getting the HD650's to achieve a ""personal concert"" feeling, or am I better looking elsewhere/sticking to what I have?


Edit. Some genres I listen are things like Jazz, Concert classical, game/movie soundtracks, light rap, some hip hop, loads of indie/harder to define genres (artists like king gizz, tame Impala, Andy shauf and Hozier)"
audiophile,"I am not going to spend more than $100. For reference, my main IEM (and the literal only pair of earphones that I own) is the Moondrop SSP.

Also, a scroll wheel is *mandatory*; I will not choose any DAP that doesn't have a physical scroll wheel for the volume controls. This might seem weird or overly nitpicky, but I am super serious about wanting a scroll wheel instead of regular ""VOL +/VOL -"" buttons.


So far, I noticed a good handful of decent-looking options. I was kind of impressed with the initial vibe check for a couple of them (every single one has a decent looking scroll wheel):


- the RUIZU A55 is $99. I really like the design of it; it has a cool ""vintage and industrial blended together"" look to it. I was able to confirm that it has a Sabre ES9018Q2C DAC; master chip is the Rockchip RK3308.

- MECHEN M30 for $99. This one seems to be of slightly worse overall quality. It uses what the product's official description calls the DAC and headphone amp ""WM8965"" and ""TPA6530"". I tried Googling those specific names and the only results were... Two rebranded versions of the literal exact same DAP.
 
- Shanling M0 Pro for $120. I honestly don't like this one very much, but I just included it here because it's only slightly over my budget.

- HIDIZS AP80 for $140. I heard good things about this one, but that price is kinda steep. I really like the purple one though...



So far, I'm leaning towards the RUIZU A55. If anyone has any other suggestions for a nice DAP with a scroll wheel for $150 or less, I'm all ears."

The effect was instant, I have put a lot of money into this system and have always had the problem that I have been listening to the equipment and not the music. With this new cable that whole sense of listening to the equipment has gone and I‚Äôm listening to the music. 

How can a power cable have such a dramatic impact on a solid state amp?

audiophile,"Hey guys,

After learning that I have my own speaker system at home, my gf's parents asked me for help in improving the acoustics in their living/TV room. The first floor of their house is an open-concept design with hardwood floors and lots of windows, which makes the solution non-obvious to me. Moreover, the house has high ceilings (10-15ft most places). Here is a drawing of their first floor layout:

[Living Room Layout](https://preview.redd.it/kfh2vmj0hnfa1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3d5bae16f970decae7e0319f49df81149cc39a0a)

The shaded black areas are the TV and couch. Right behind the couch is an elevated shelf that goes to about chest height, but still opens up into the room behind it because that part of the house is raised by a foot or so. The issue is that the room has tons of echo, which makes dialog hard to understand and generally detracts from the movie experience.

 They already have a high-quality 3.1 speaker system, so sound production is not the issue here. They plan to put a rug between the TV and couch, but I think that will only help a little. They also don't like the idea of putting curtains on the windows, since the house is in a wooded area and the forest views outside are quite nice. **Is there any other way to improve the room acoustic situation, or is it hopeless without curtains?**"

Since you have to choose an output in windows. Do I need to get a separate DAC, like the audio engine D1 DAC? Do I have to unplug a cable when using one or the other if I'm running both from the same DAC?"
audiophile,"So we moved into a newly built house in the Austin area and a few days after moving I realized my guitar tube amp was catching an AM radio station and wouldn‚Äôt stop buzzing. Now that I have a new tube stereo amp, it‚Äôs doing the same which has ruined listening to music at home for me. Anyone know what can be done?

audiophile,"So im looking for a new pair of earbuds for mainly for work.  For background im a delivery driver and my truck is LOUD!  Im talking rattling doors, gaps where wind passes through to make high pitch whistles, dashboard banging around, and everything inbetween.  So im looking for a new pair of earbuds that sound great, blocks the background noise, lasts longer than 4 hours before a recharge, and sound great for voice calls.  

I listen to music, podcasts, and my coworkers complain.  I have a pair of samsung galaxy buds + that ive had forever and i like them but the right bud is hardcore struggling so i need something better or comparable.  Ive had bose in the past that where good for music but i couldnt hear my podcasts or voice calls for squat. Just no apple products; i refuse anything apple related."

audiophile,"Hello I'm trying to decide between the Anthem STR 2 channel integrated ($4,999) and the Anthem MRX 1140 AVR ($4,199). 

I mainly listen to 2 channel music and movies and have my TV connected to my current receiver, a Integra DTC 9.8 thru an optical cable and use a B&amp;K Reference S2 5 channel amp. (Use 4 channels for bi-amping speakers)

I recently bought Polk L600 speakers and feel like my current setup is not bringing out the full capabilities of them. 

One complaint of the L600s is that during shows and movies, the dialog is very sensitive to where you sit, so you have to be almost dead center to hear even voices, and not hear them coming from one side or the other. So that leads to wanting to add a center channel speaker to help with that hence wanting an AVR.

How much better sounding would the dedicated stereo amp sound compared to the AVR? Music is my main focus."

audiophile,"I posted this over in /r/hometheater but wanted to see if anyone over here had any ideas.

I am currently running two separate audio systems day to day and was wondering what the best way to migrate to one setup would be.

I'll start with the setup to be replaced:

* Vizio Elevate soundbar.

I use that as the main output for anything involving my TV (LG C2).

What I want to do is begin using my record/streaming setup for both its current purpose and for TV, movies, games, etc.

That setup includes:

* Kilpsch Forte IV speakers

* Schiit Audio Freya tube preamp

* Schiit Audio Aegir power amp

* Schiit Audio Bifrost DAC

* Chromecast Audio

* Pro-Ject turntable

Is there a best way to retain my current Hi-Fi setup and also use it in a HT setup? I've been eyeing a Yamaha A4A receiver, but I'm not sure of how it would all fit together in the long run or if that's even the best option for my situation. I would obviously need to buy more speakers for a full setup, but I wanted to see what I would be getting into first.

Thanks!"
audiophile,"Customer had these laying around in his basement after his kid put a pencil through all of his speakers/woofers. The last A/V guy had ordered these and then apparently ghosted before replacing them. Unfortunately he tossed the original damaged boxes/amps as well as the rest of his damaged speakers.

Handed these off to me, and now I'm in the process of deciding how to build them. I have a two channel fathom amp which is a wonderful coincidence. 

I'm thinking a kerfed cherry cabinet to match my ML Electrostatics. Can't find any specifics on the woofers though, but they appear to be modified W7's."
audiophile,"I recently purchased these bad boys, and my first thought is ""source matters""Bad source, they sound way too bright.Good source, they sound incredible.

I was worried about the source bit.  My old Polk RTI70s did a great job of evening out bad sources and heavy rock distortion with those silk dome tweeters.  Take the clarity down just a touch, and just about everything sounded good.  Not great, but pretty damn good.The Kefs are far more precise, but that brings out the worst in recordings that aren't great.

Bass isn't great.  Great subwoofers are a must in my opinion, so I'm not surprised the bass response disappointed me.  Paired with some DIY Peerless Tympany 15"" subs and I get exactly what I'm looking for.... When the source is on point.I'm still breaking them in a bit, so maybe they'll smooth out with time.  But the difference between Vinyl and Tidal, over Spotify is almost alarming.  I understand this is an audiophile subreddit, so the suggestion of Spotify hurts people's brains.  Unfortunately, I've been using Spotify for too long, and that's where all my playlists are.  Looks like I'll be rebuilding all of them in Tidal.  Kudos to the sound quality on Tidal btw.  Beats my current vinyl setup for sure."

audiophile,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently moved into a new complex and the unit came with built in bluetooth/home theatre speakers. The complex told me the speakers may or may not work as the company no longer exists or they didn't renew their contract (not sure exactly). My question is, despite being connected, I cannot get any sound to play. I've been troubleshooting this for about 2 months and have found limited information. All lights seem to be displaying how they should - from ARIA user manuals I've found online. Someone in the office staff also said they had connected to my unit and had been able to hear from them. Does anyone know what could be the issue? I don't think it would be that the apartment staff is connected still since they wouldn't be in range anyway to connect. Any insight would be great as I love music and these speakers would be SUCH a blessing. Thanks!"
audiophile,"I recently got back into listening to music because someone gave me an LP and I bought a turntable, then an amp, then speakers, then a day, then a streamer, then another amp for some spare speakers. I thought I would provide (inflict on) everyone my summary experience.

* Rega Brio Amp (5/5)- I got on sale for $800. Outstanding. No problems.
* Focal Chora 806 Speakers (5/5) - on sale for $600. Outstanding. No problems. Go great with the Brio.
* Aiyima 07 (2/5): Would not power my old AR-2s. Very muddy and low volume. Switched it to my Paradigm Atom V2, and it was louder but not great. Contacted support; no response after a week. Returning the unit.
* Schiit Modi+ DAC: (4.5/5): Sounds great. Better than my old Fiio X3, but is it worth the extra money? I don't know. I would give it a 5/5 nonetheless if not for the fact that I contacted them for support and got no answer after a week.
* Wiim Pro: (2/5): Started out promising, but then it stopped outputting music from Amazon Unlimited through line out, and it would not launch Qobuz at all. Contacted support twice, and got no response. They did ""close"" my ticket for some reason! Returning the unit.
* [**Audio**-Technica AT-LP3BK Fully Automatic Belt-Drive Stereo Turntable, Black](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N6YK1GA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) 3/5): Only fair. It has started skating despite my efforts to rebalance and clean the stylus. Have not yet contacted support.
* Qobuz: I was dubious, but I found that the sound is actually better than Apple Music Hi-res, at least when played iPad--&gt;Schiit Modi+ --&gt; Rega Brio --&gt; Focal Chora 806. I like this service and may keep it.

I am sorry to report my experience with the Wiim Pro and the Aiyima, which seem to be favorites here, but I have to be honest. On the other hand, I am very happy with the Rega, Focal, and Schiit components. They are winners at a reasonable if not ultra-cheap price."

audiophile,"Love, loss and headphones (a story of grief) 

Hey everyone, so glad to find the community. You can call me T, I have been a headphone/hifi enthusiast for 12 years now, since 13. Something about new headphones, ipods always made me so happy, upgrading slowly over the years. My first fiio at 17 was mind blowing, starting me down the hifi rabbit hole, I started building my own home theater from there, learning to dj and continuing my art practice. I was 13 years old when I lost my father, fifteen and sixteen losing my grandmothers, at 18 I lost two close friends. I never considered myself a stranger to loss. Throughout my teen years I had alot of gear stolen by abusive family members, I had to learn to work, save and build my collections back up, bikes, headphones, players, jewelry, even clothing and cologne, nothing was off limits. Eventually I find my way out of home, living on my own being happy, 22. Get into my first committed relationship, hes a musician and producer, how perfect... I was on a pink cloud, we get our own apartment after seven months, life on south beach is amazing, I'm happy, healthy, learning to live in relative stability, safety for the first time; tho apparently not for him, I was too needy(he just wanted to be alone) Four days after my birthday, I'm being dumped, told to leave the apartment, I have to move back home. I was destroyed. Having to move back into a home where my things were stolen and I was abused, tho the perpetrator is gone now. I learn to heal, blast my system (Harmon receiver, jbl surrounds and infinity floor standing, two ten inch woofers) I listen to washed out, lsd and the search for God, Jesus and Mary chain, I cry, I sing, I laugh, a few days pass, still lost in grief over losing my relationship, I make an attempt on my life. I am swiftly institutionalized, terrified, tho still holding on to hope, just looking forward to getting back to my gear, I get home after three days and try to go back to normal. Start to realize how abusive the relationship actually was (I was basically trapped) Focus on healing. My oldest brother starts visiting with us, I'm so happy about it. I show him music I enjoy, music I have been working on, he encourages my art practice, I show him paintings, we smoke, we talk, we laugh. Things are finally going back to normal, I spend time with my nieces and nephews. I take gratitude, holding on to these memories, I knew they wouldn't last long. I didn't know it would be the last I would see my brother alive. Two nights later I hear my mother screaming his name, begging him to wake up, the sound is piercing, my blood runs cold. I run downstairs and I see the nightmare, he is slumped over in the bathroom, we already knew what was happening. I try the narcan, cpr, nothing works. Ambulance comes...my house is now a crime scene. having to explain to my mother that he wouldn't be going to the hospital, that it was too late to try was heartbreaking. I feel raw, depressed, working hard not to fall back into the dark place I was after the breakup. The brother we all loved is gone, a father and husband, the man who first showed me fl studio, the man who encouraged my art, and helped me with my first surround, the brother I had all these lifelong memories with, is gone. The whole family is shaken, I have to explain to my nephews why their dad isn't coming back home; my heart is shattered and I struggle for a while to move on. Onwards two months, My fiio m11 dies, I get the m11+, ex doesn't return my AKGs, I cut him off. Decide fuck it, nows my chance to dive back into the headphone game. Start researching, looking into planar vs dynamics, impedance vs sensitivity, start brushing up on all these terms and specs, balanced vs single ended, closed back vs open, etc... I feel myself finally getting back to things I enjoy, my head spins with choices and new info. I decided on a pair of hifiman he 4xx, place the order and wait. Downloaded high res files to test them with, prepare my art room for listening, buy a stand for my dap, finally get them, and my mind is blown. Listening to Stevie Knicks, piero umiliani, lsd and the search for God, egberto gismonti, lapalux, boards of Canada, bonobo, the flashbulb, all the music I had shown my brother Evian in the weeks before he passed. I am over taken with emotion, I start to cry. these headphones regularly bring tears to my eyes, I never realized how much the cans can actually change things, surely if it was just the music my Ath m50 would be doing the same? But they don't. I feel proud of my purchase, proud I have something to share. I let my friends and family demo them, their reactions ranging from actual tears, to smiling and laughing, to down right astonishment at what they are hearing, it brings me so much joy. They give me a reason to enjoy my day, and relax and the end of it, these planars have completely reignited my passion for sound to the point it brings me to tears, I feel happy to finally have an appropriate pairing for my dap. It's been alot of hard work of course, kicking habits that no longer served me, choosing the things that bring me joy, I never knew a pair of headphones can actually be so healing. That a pair of headphones marked the end of my grief for a former relationship, that a pair of headphones helped me process the loss of my own brother. blowing my mind open to new music, new experiences, and a new way to be, to process my emotions. I know this post is a little bit raw, I have been wanting to share this for a while, to show that this hobby really helps people, it may even save lives, maybe give someone out their some hope. I know it's only a pair of headphones, it what you do with them that decides their final value, like family and memories, I am learning to cherish the smallest of moments, I know it will take time to heal fully. Wishing only the best for everyone here, and that no one experiences loss like this. Never forget to cherish what you have, you never know when it will be gone.

audiophile,"I have an old Harman Kardon receiver from 1998 that I repaired recently, up untill now I have been powering my set of JBL XE-4 using a car headunit hooked up from my TV aux while the harman was being repaired.

I got into a debate with my brother about the harman sounding better while he argues that its placebo. 

Since the harman was connected with optical where as the headunit rely on the TV's built in DAC.

So to solve this once and for all, we built a switch box and did some blind testing.

We did 2 rounds of testing with 4 tracks each round.

For the first round, I was surprised that I couldn't tell apart the difference between the 2 but based on random guessing I choose the harman.

So we did it a second time and this time he told me to face away from the front so I wouldn't see him switching (even though my eyes were closed the whole time) 

and the results for the second round were 50/50 and my guesses were also a shot in the dark.

It's a disappointment to say the least but I'll admit this methodology is flawed, but I can't hear the difference between the 2 and even if it exists it was super hard to pick up on.

Still, this made me wondered and raises an interesting question as to, can you actually hear the difference between receivers / amp dac combos? And is it actually worth spending a whole lot on these equipments? 

For me though, I like good looking equipments so its worth it to me as I value the aesthetic of my setup haha"

Does anyone have a FiiO BTR5/BTR7 to test the sample rate of the IOS music app (without Apple music subscription) playing back LOCAL .flac files? (READ THE REST)

I recently discovered using 3uTools you can copy .flac files directly over to an iPhone or iPad without converting them to ALAC or .m4a (as you would have to using iTunes). However, I'm not sure if the music app can even play back hi-res local .flacs 24bit/192kHz files (at the native samples rate) (or even with ALAC .m4a). Because I'm seeing online that it might cut off at a lower sample rate.

I understand that you need an external DAC to even decode anything above 24bit/48kHz on iPhone according to them. However, I'm not sure if it's even getting this far. Meaning the music app itself might be resampling

There is also the other option of using 3rd party music player I've been using Flacbox with when FFMPEG is enabled it claims to go up to 96kHZ but I can't verify. which I would like to test too.

If anyone has a FiiO BTR5/BTR7 and an IOS device and would like to help this very scientific community it would be very apricated.

3 Things I need tested - Sample rate for all 3

1. Local playback of 24bit/192khz .flac via default music app (without apple music subscription) (using 3uTools to transfer flacs to IOS device)
2. Local playback of 24bit/192khz .flac via Flacbox 3rd party app (WITHOUT FFMPEG enabled)
3. Local playback of 24bit/192khz .flac via Flacbox 3rd party app (WITH FFMPEG enabled at 96khz)

Link to 24bit/192khz track if needed

audiophile,"Hi Reddit,

My father passed down a couple very nice components for a hi-fi system. I have minimal knowledge about audio systems, and I do not have the spending power to match this quality with components going forward, most likely, but I do want to make good use of what I now have:

1. [Pathos Classic One Amp/Preamp](https://upscaleaudio.com/products/pathos-classic-one-mkiii-vacuum-tube-integrated-amplifier)
2. [Reference MM de Capo Speakers](https://www.stereophile.com/standloudspeakers/1203reference3a/index.html)

**Goal:** Listen to Hi-Fi quality streaming without spending a fortune.

**Current Solution:** Using Spotify on a spare laptop, and connecting the laptop directly to the amplifier with Amazon Basics 3.5mm to stereo cables.

**My idea for what will make the biggest difference:** Buy a \~$200 DAC and subscribe to Tidal music. Does this seem like it will be the best bang for my buck? Any other suggestions are appreciated.

audiophile,"So I want to upgrade my passat speakers into better ones (woofers to be exact). The problem is that passat B6, unlike my previous Golf IV, has these speaker adaptors. They're plastic bits that hold the whole speaker in place. How do I know that the holes of the speaker will align with the adaptor? I've looked through vendors and one of them, called ""CrutchField"" shows me what speakers should fit. But they say I'll have to fabricate a mounting bracket, what the fuck is that? English isn't my first language and I can't seem to find proper information on what to do.

On a side note, I will not order from them since I think they ship only in USA, also I would love any tips from you guys when choosing the speakers. How to know if I'll need an amplifier?"

audiophile,"I've realised that when I play Apple Music in my. car the sound isn't as loud (bass-y?) as Spotify. Sometimes if I close the app and re-open it'll go super loud - how I expect it to be, only to reduce the volume after the track or 2. I toggled with the Apple Music settings, but to no avail, so I'm wondering if there's an aux cable that would be consistently loud? I also might be either crazy or fucking stupid cos the sound is louder on Spotify but I hate the look of the app. Can anyone help with suggestions?"
audiophile,"Hey all,

I recently noticed a difference in latency between my built-in computer DAC and my Focusrite Scarlet Solo. I use the Focusrite paired with my Sennheiser HD 650 headphones and while playing rhythm games, I can hear the slight latency difference.

I'm curious as to why this might be the case and if anyone else has experienced similar issues. I know that even a few milliseconds can make a difference in these types of games and I'm looking for a solution to make the latency as low as possible.

Has anyone else had this issue or has any advice on how to improve my setup?

Thanks in advance!"
audiophile,"Hey guys, so I recently picked up some Focals and posted them here, so far I have been absolutely loving them!! For the past 7ish years, since I was 17 and had my first set up, I've been using a Pioneer elite VSX-45 integrated amp. It's given me countless hours of joy, but I'm finally read to upgrade them and move into a more serious direction. After spending a lot of time researching looking at the current market on integrated amps on the market right now, I've decided I want to go for longevity and just go with a pre+pro set up. 

So the ones that I'm really looking at right now are the:

Rotel RC-1590 MKII preamplifier

and for power the Rotel RB-1590. 

what I'm comparing against is the NAD C 658 pre and the NAD M23 power amp.

audiophile,"I have a Hegel H160 and F35's (+B110 sub) and it's a wonderful set, but as it usually goes, why not spend a few grand for something more. So I went to test F228Be's on a Hegel H590 and certainly they sounded great, filled a bigger space beautifully even at lower volumes and had immense control over detail and certain kinds of dynamics. I also tried the H190, but couldn't hear any benefit over my H160 really. My main issue was that they didn't sound so different from what I have now. Just more of the same and some polish on top. I was thinking to get a Hegel 390 (should sound similar to 590) and the F228Be's, but it seemed like a $15k(‚Ç¨) investment for a bit fuller sound mostly. I wish there was an F38 or that F208 came in white. Might need to repaint or vinyl wrap a pair or something since I doubt I would care to pay much for the difference.

They suggested I come test the Founder 120H in a few days since apparently they can't sell the high-end Revels anymore after people hear those. Does anyone have any thoughts about any of these or similar experiences of having had huge expectations that just weren't met?"

audiophile,"Picked up these Klipsch KG2.2 on Saturday and have been doing some listening of all kinds since then. I know the sonic limitations of having these directly on the hardwood floor, bass reflections, etc, but I also tried them on the stands for my epi 100, with excellent results.

The most impressive part about these 6.5"" MTM design is the bass response. Crisp, clear and digs plenty deep for near field or small room listening. Have them positioned approximately 1 meter from rear wall and bass port firing into the grills of my epi speakers since I don't have sound deadening behind them. 

I'm still going back and forth on converting them to active/Bluetooth speakers, because why not. They will get a makeover, though. Need to find a pattern for the grill so I can make some, but thats not urgent.

audiophile,"Sure, it's easy (except for cost) to try different components or interconnects, even speakers‚Äîbut room arrangements immediately invoke the Spouse Acceptance Factor and other domestic concerns. How often have you had to explain why the speakers can't go against the wall, or why it's necessary to put sound-absorbing materials in specific places? Unless one is so fortunate as to have a dedicated listening room, such fights are usually settled by compromise and concession. At least 24% of us are dissatisfied, unable to wring further concessions from those with whom we share our space. More panels and Tube Traps? Not options.

Along comes Rives Audio, a company focusing on small-room acoustics and related services, with its Parametric Adaptive Room Compensation, or PARC: a sophisticated analog parametric equalizer (footnote 1) that purports to accomplish significant low-frequency correction of room modes. By restricting its responsibilities to the 16-350Hz band, by using attenuation only, and by dint of its design and construction, Rives intends the PARC to be used in systems of the highest quality.

audiophile,"Hello everyone.

I'm a bit of a noob with audio gear, so I need your help.

My use cases are gaming, music listening and music production (EDM mostly).

I went through a couple of good quality headphones, and I've had a great experience.

This is my audio journey, so far:Sennheiser HD568 -&gt; Beyerdynamic DT990 32ohm -&gt; Beyerdynamic T90 -&gt; Beyerdynamic DT1990.

I've used the first two with my computer's sound card, but after getting the T90s, they felt really weak - especially on the bass side of things.

That was the moment I knew I needed an amp.

I managed to pick up the ProJect Head Box DS second hand for about $90.

It seems to drive both the T90s and the DT1990s pretty well (as far as I can tell), but I'm wondering if I could squeeze better sound out of them with a better amp, or if it doesn't matter that much."

audiophile,"This may be a bit of a long-winded post from someone who really doesn't know a ton about the technical side of audio, so bear with me.

Tldr; Is my modern budget AVR (Denon AVR-650H) a better choice for music than a vintage budget integrated amplifier (MCS 3872)? 

So I've had the Denon AVR for a few years now. It powers my 5.1 ""home theater"" system. It has been great for me. I used it for stereo music from time to time as well, again, was great. I recently moved, got back into vinyl, hooked a turntable to it, and was very disappointed  with the sound. Sounded really hollow and lifeless.

So I bought the MCS, and it sounded similar; BUT, the loudness button paired with the ability to easily EQ the sound brought it to life.

As I dig deeper into the technical side of audio, I'm starting to think that a big reason for the disappointing sound is the lack of room correction I've done at the new place. I lost the Audyssey mic years ago.

So, I buy a new mic with the intention of using Audyssey for room correction with movies. Was planning to continue using the MCS for music.

Now I'm wondering if I've over complicated this entire process for myself, and spent time buying and integrating components that I don't need.

Does it make more sense to hook the turntable up to the AVR and take advantage of the room correction and EQ that is Audyssey? Am I overthinking this?

I know the components I'm working with are well below the level of many systems in this sub, I'm just trying to get the best sound I can afford."
audiophile,"I know you can't tell, but Voodoo by D'Angelo sounds awesome. The KLH 5s are easily the best pair of speakers I've owned.  Great sound stage, great clarity, and bass response.  Great dynamics too. I don't think they need a sub or anything if you're on the fence about a sealed speaker.

audiophile,"I have bookshelf speakers connected to my desktop. There's a volume knob on the speakers.

I decided to lower the volume on the knob located on the actual speakers because the volume got very loud at 30% - 50% volume in Windows. I decided that I didn't want to run the risk of damaging the speakers or my hearing if the volume is accidentally tuned to 70% in volume.

After lowering the volume using the knob located on the speakers. I can now tune the Windows volume to 80 - 90% volume while remaining at acceptable volume levels though I noticed that the bass and treble was reduced even at comparable volumes when using high hardware volume/low Windows volume. Essentially, the frequency response sounds a lot flatter the more you lower the volume on the actual hardware.

Is this normal or this merely placebo?"

audiophile,"Most of what I've read on Zone 2 via an AVR make it sound like the amplified signal is a little blah (assuming you'd use it for a pool / garden or something). 

I was wondering if anyone uses the Zone 2 (on, lets say a nice Denon / Marantz / Pioneer AVR) for hifi stereo? I'm not looking to match a mono block system or anything, but thought a night powerful AVR might still put out good sound for stereo. BUT does the Zone 2 use a smaller amplifier circuit or anything that would make this less than ideal?

I'm hunting around for used high-end AVR's from about 10 years ago or order....like something that was $1-$2k new in the 90's.

Thanks in advance!"
audiophile,"After shopping for some time I finally decided to just pull the trigger on these Focal speakers. The shop up the street had them and they were 28% off for the demo pair. I recently upgraded my amp to a Marantz pm7000n and probably should have gotten speakers first, but I'm happy with how they sound. 

The project debut carbon is probably the weak link here, but for those with the same amp how do you find the built in DAC? I stream more often than spin vinyl so I'm curious what people think is the weak spot, turntable or DAC?

I'm too busy enjoying them now to think about upgrading, but there's always tomorrow."

audiophile,"Tangential to audiophile realms of course, but I'm thinking this is probably the best place to have this conversation. A year ago I lost 20db of hearing in my left ear, and so I'm pretty keen on keeping all the hearing I have left, but still want to enjoy concerts.

So I'm on the hunt for the cleanest audio dampening ear protection for use in concerts, and my hunt has pretty much landed me on custom molded ear protection that musicians often use. The two main reasons for looking at custom molded musician options is for maximum protection and that filters can be switched out based on registered loudness at a show (I have a db meter on my phone so I can have data to guide the choice).

I'm thinking of getting maximum relief, 30db or so, given that rock concerts are purported to range from 105 to 130 or more db. If a show is registering 130db, even 30db of suppression is barely passable to avoid damage.

If anyone has experience with these, I'm very interested in hearing your experiences.

First option is [Microsonic Pulse](https://microsonic-inc.com/pulse/). Frankly I'd just pull the trigger given this is what my audiologist sells, but if you look at the response curve for the P30 filter, the suppression jumps to 35db at 8000Hz, so I'm a little worried that will make things sound muddy.

Next option is the [MEE Audio](https://pro.meeaudio.com/custom-earplugs.html)custom molded set, but their 25db suppression has a 5db dip at 4000Hz.

[Westone TRU Customs](https://www.westone.com/defendear/tru-customs) are all over the place on the response curve (it's one of the product photos)

Those are the ones I've seen so far. Anyone have recommendations for these or other options available in America?"

I browse here daily but I basically have subbed to this subreddit for nearly 10 years just because I like looking at pics of other people‚Äôs gear, and those are most of the posts I make myself‚Ä¶ The reason is that for a long time, and currently, I assume, the rules of this subreddit have been no discussion about gear choices or system setup.

But I guess, being an audiophile sub, it does seem like most people would want to check out other people‚Äôs gear and systems, and that‚Äôs still ok‚Ä¶

So why the emphasis in this sub about how much gear costs all the time, or what a value something is, or a ripoff, or how gullible the OP is for making that choice vs my choice.  

Maybe check out r/budgetaudiophile and  I‚Äôm  not  even  being  condescending,  but  if  the  focus  is  on  how  much  gear  costs,  or  the  OPs  financial  choices  and  decisions,  there  is  a  subreddit  specifically  with  pricing  and  budget  in  the  name  of  the  subreddit.

Do you think it would be worth it to have like a 5.1 or 7.1 sound for a massage environment rather than the one speaker to try and add a kind of whole enveloping feel for the client rather than having a single speaker? If so what would you recommend for this type of application? Volume wouldn't matter more so quality of sound and speaker placement. 
I'm very new to this so any help is appreciated. I'm hoping to have my own business and I'm thinking about how I can have some kind of next level experience vs other establishments. 
Thank you"
audiophile,is there something i can plug into the headphone jack that i can use my bt headphone on it?
audiophile,"Looking for opinions on bookshelf speakers in the 600$-1500$ range. Going to be placed in a small-ish room (5m x 4m). Speakers must have deep extension, as I would like to put off buying a subwoofer until I move to bigger place."
audiophile,"So I am very new to this and want to build a good setup to play my CD collection as cheaply as possible. I don't know much about dacs, amps, or anything else. this is what I'm planning on saving to buy, do you guys have any suggestions or things that aren't necessary for this list? 

Also, it reaches 1700$, is it too much to start with?

Thanks a lot!"

audiophile,"I've owned two M-AUDIO BX8's for under half a year now and haven't noticed any issues until I touched the back. I understand that the metal is supposed to act as a heat sink, but this thing felt like it could burn my hand. I've only used them powered on for around 6 hours, I'm not sure if the heat is normal for a studio speaker of this size. The speakers work completely fine.

Any advice would be appreciated."
audiophile,"Hey guys,
My vinyls are pretty bent because my brother stored them horribly wrong. 
At my work place we have a hydrolic press where I could fit all of them in. 

Now my question is whether that would work or help at all and if yes, how much pressure I'd need per record. 
Thanks in advance"
audiophile,"Hello :))

I have just perched a audio interface called Mackie Big Knob Studio 3x2 and it doesn't come with a power supply and I need help to find the correct power supply it needs

I was able to find the original one but they only sell in America (I'm from UK) and way to expensive. I believe the name of the original one is Mackie BP-2047883-00

If anyone could please help me find a power supply I could easily by on UK  amazon I will be very grateful.

audiophile,"Hi All! Im moving to US from EU and due to costs of goods shipment I will be buying a whole new Hi-Fi set. I currently own Dali Zensor 5.1 set w/ Denon 2400h.

I‚Äôm looking to buy the following set from Klipsch as they seem to be most reasonably priced speakers in US:

Front: Klipsch rp5000f
Surround: R40m
Center: R30c
Sub: R101sw (or svs pb-1000)

Can you please recommend:
a) any changes to above, I‚Äôm not fixed on brand and budget but don‚Äôt want to spend much more either. This set should cost around 1800$
b) av-receiver for this set - I‚Äôm currently thinking of Denon AVR x1700h
I don‚Äôt mind going for other brands if better. This one is currently for 700$

Thanks!"
audiophile,"I‚Äôm considering using my speaker amp to drive my headphones perhaps for a change in sound quality over just using a dedicated headphone amp. My speaker amp only uses the tube rectifiers on the speaker out signal chain though, so in order to use the tubes I‚Äôd need to patch into the speaker posts. I know impedance matching would be a consideration so I‚Äôm looking at something like this Zynsonix converter box: 
[https://www.zynsonix.com/Speaker-Amp-to-Headphone-Converter-Box-Bypass_p_54.html](https://www.zynsonix.com/Speaker-Amp-to-Headphone-Converter-Box-Bypass_p_54.html)

Does anybody have experience doing something like that using a speaker amp for your headphones and what were your results? Or if you have any thoughts on doing this I‚Äôd be curious to hear your take on it. I think it would be interesting? Lmk thanks!"
audiophile,"Do the different product ranges of Dali have their own distinctive characteristics?

Maybe the Oberon has better lows and the Opticon is a more budget product line, or perhaps the Spektor uses different materials?

Bonus points if you can explain what the numbers mean, e.g. Opticon 5, Spektor 6.. It seems like larger numbers mean more volume/surface area, but I'm not sure.

I assume there's some logic in the naming scheme, but so far I can't figure it out."
audiophile,"First of all, I don't know where to post this so I'm sorry if it's kind of off-topic. I'm using foobar, and I even have a skin for it, but to be honest I don't like the feel of it. What I'm looking for is something that *feels* like a streaming service but actually plays my locally stored flac files. As long as it looks nice and can play lossless formats, I'm willing to sacrifice other features. Does anyone know of a player like that?"
audiophile,"I've been shopping for a CD transport, or a CD player that I can use as a transport (with TOSLINK output), and feeling more and more like I'm running in circles and getting nowhere.  So, here are a few observations. . .

Stereo component reviews drive me up the wall.  When I run a search for reviews on a product, I get swamped with press releases thinly disguised as reviews, and pages of storefronts trying to sell me the unit.  Actual reviews-as-such are surprisingly thin on the ground.

And when I do find a review?  It often turns out to be hogwash.  Let me provide an example of what I mean:  [https://theaudiophileman.com/cdt-cd-transport-review-leak/](https://theaudiophileman.com/cdt-cd-transport-review-leak/)

With a website called ""The Audiophile Man"" and a full page with lots of pics and hands-on experience, this looks legit.  I scanned it for the two major bits of information that I wanted most:  1) How well does it track marginal, lightly damaged discs?, and 2) Will it scratch or scuff my discs?  (Dumb question.  It's a slot-loader; of course it will scratch discs.)

I'll save you from reading through the entire article.  Neither subject is mentioned anywhere in it.  However, there is florid ""audiophile wine snob"" doubletalk.  (And just to be clear, I totally consider myself an audiophile.  Just not, you know, an idiotic one.)  Anyhow, from the review:

&gt; My first impression with the CDT, like Leak‚Äôs Stereo 130 amplifier, was the discipline across the frequency spectrum.  Whether you‚Äôre talking treble, midrange or bass, the CDT never played the baddie it never hit you with any boomy bass or bright mids. You never found yourself wincing or reaching to lower the gain. This CD transport is nothing if not civilised. It‚Äôs the nearest CD transport to family friendly that you‚Äôll find currently on the market.

Man, it's a TRANSPORT.  It reads the data off the disc and sends it out the door.  It has no sound of its own.  And then he compares it with another transport, the Audiolab 6000CDT:

&gt; The Audiolab is strictly neutral. It‚Äôs strictly balanced. The Leak is not. It has that midrange smoothness. In midrange terms, the Audiolab has a greater degree of precision in the upper mids. So, aggressive guitar strums have real bite and focus while the Leak softens that focus and pulls back on the bite to make the effect less intense but possibly for some, more approachable.

Man, these are both TRANSPORTS.  They both read the same data off the same disc and send it out the door to the same DAC.  Unless something has gone badly wrong with the engineering of these components (to include the DAC), they should sound the same.

So, here's my next idea...  I could get a Japanese basic CD player from Yamaha, Onkyo, NAD or Denon.  They're cheap, they're tray loaders that won't scratch my discs, and they have TOSLINK output.  But they must be shoddy, right?  Inferior.  I mean, those prices!

My working hypothesis is that these should make good transports.  The Japanese are fanatical about manufacturing quality.  Yeah, I know those are not manufactured in Japan anymore, but they'll make sure it's done right in China or Malaysia or Vietnam.  Ah, Vietnam!  You are source of the world's worst writing paper and the world's worst coffee.  I'm sure building a CD player there can only work out well.

Moreover, the audio CD remains quite popular in Japan.  That means they can sell a lot of units in their home market, and those economies of scale are what enable the aggressive pricing.  And finally...  I suspect that nobody produces a CD mechanism anymore that's truly built for long service life.  All CD players now, regardless of price, are basically semi-disposable units that you can reasonably expect to last four or five years and then replace.  Thus, it doesn't make much sense to splash out for an expensive one.

One gripe I have is that these players are available only in black and look like generic stereo components from the 1980s.  Personally, I favor more of a 1960s and 1970s vibe, which is why I swooned over the LEAK CDT with its wood paneling.  But I digress.  What really irks me is that these companies often produce both black and silver options, which they sell in other markets, in Japan and in Europe, but not in the USA.  ""No silver for you!""  And yet, they look so much better in silver.

The height of absurdity came when I looked on eBay and found Yamaha silver units, used units, from sellers in Japan, and the asking price was almost double that of a brand new black unit in the USA.  Am I going to pay double for a used, warranty-less unit just so I can get silver?  Heaven help me, for a few moments of weakness I was actually tempted.  But no.  Not gonna happen.

So anyhow, the quest goes on."
audiophile,"Had to sell my surround sound speakers in 2020 in prep for a big move. I got the sound bar temporary for use in a small apartment. I'll be getting a new speaker system in the next year, but was curious if was possible or even worth hooking up my Denon to the sound bar for now. Thanks."
audiophile,"I have the newest gen 3 node, paired to a McIntosh MA352 amp and Focal Aria 926 speakers. 

I use a series of bluesound powernodes around my house for in ceiling audio in different zones than my main listening area. 

Therefore, I want to stay in the BluOS ecosystem and I like how the streamer can do HDMI arc from my tv as well. 

It seems to make sense to stay in the BluOS ecosystem, so my question is, is it worth going for an external dac, or is there a way to get a streamer/dac that is higher quality where I can still use BluOS through?"
audiophile,"Was relaxing today and thinking of this while enjoy some nice music. What are your favorite audio bliss/float away on a cloud of beautiful music while sipping a whiskey speakers? They might not be the most technically proficient or the most accurate but the speakers that just put you in that relaxed smooth enjoying the music sense. Some could call them romantic sounding speakers maybe? Wondering what everyone‚Äôs favorites are or ones they have heard they really stood out for this quality. The speaker you‚Äôd pick with your feet up, late at night, sipping a drink in the late hours of the night or into early hours of the morning."
audiophile,"Is it possible that by using a 2 Way Speaker (4Ohm) with the wrong tweeter (8Ohm) but with the original passive crossover, the woofer (4Ohm) gets killed by the crossover (possibly it send the wrong frequencys to the woofer?)? I get that using a crossover with different speakers then it was intendet is bad for the sound but i got two of these speakers as a gift and the original tweeters were replaced already. I do have the original 4Ohm tweeters but the other ones (8Ohm) sound better somehow so im just questioning if it is bad for the woofer. One of the woofers broke not longe ago and i dont want to kill the other one and im even thinking about replacing the woofer. So is it bad for the Woofer due to the 8Ohm 4Ohm imbalance? Im a newbie but very willing to learn so dont be too harsh."
audiophile,The audio gods have been good to me lately. In the pursuit of optimal playback I located an Rives Audio PARC. Awaiting the arrival of a couple of diffuser and sound card for mead ent and adjustment of bass nodes. The PARC lives up to the scattering of reviews. It does no harm.

Good evening and apologies if this isn't the right avenue.

I recently purchased a home with an inop old xantech IR system which I'm looking to either repair or replace. 

The Living room has overhead recessed speakers as well as wall flush mounted. I suspect the other end of the speaker wire is in this outlet and under the TV. See photos. Is there a way to connect the open speaker wire to a TV or soundboard or adapter for Bluetooth? 

This is the old way I think:

There is a Xantech 780-10 IR receiver in the living room and master. Both have an incoming conduit with 12VDC, a ground, and IR out. They have the red and green indicator lights (inop) behind the black shield. The Master bedroom has an analog volume adjuster next to the receiver. I've also found a  Leviton panel however I haven't found any connecting blocks or any source for the 2 receivers.

From what I understand these 2 receivers are supposed to receive the 12vdc from a 789-44 connecting block or something similar. 

Lastly, each of the outlets as well as under the TV have Accusound speaker wire bundle(red/black) disconnected on both ends.

I'm not sure if it was designed for remotes or audio or both. Is this something you cna potentially fix? I think all the existing wiring and hardware is there with the exception of the connecting block."
audiophile,I have a Fisher 500c and I made a bucking transformer to dial down the voltage.  I have the option of either 107 volts or 113 volts as my incoming voltage tends to be 122 to 125.  The unit is rated for 105-120.  I've gone through a couple of tubes and I'm hoping the lower voltage will mitigate this problem.  Which is best?  107 or 113?  Thanks.

audiophile,"Okay weird question that‚Äôs totally going to expose my ignorance: 

Can I use my FiiO K9Pro DAC/Amp for my turntable so I can use headphones? 

I have a FiiO K9Pro that I use for streaming with Tidal and either Sennheiser Hd650s or my HiFiman EXS. 

I also love vinyl but I want to be able to listen to vinyl with headphones. Obviously nicer Turntables don‚Äôt have headphones jacks and neither do most phonostages/preamps. I know there are headphone amps for vinyl TTs but can I just use my FiiO K9Pro with my TT? Not sure how that works since the FiiO is a DAC/Amp and TTs don‚Äôt need DACs obviously."
audiophile,"Hello, I am looking to remove the cable that originally comes with these and do a mod that adds a port for a detachable cable for the headphones. Has anyone attempted this with these?"
audiophile,This is something I‚Äôm new to but I always think my audio balancing is off. Can I get some help? Here‚Äôs an example [YouTube](https://youtu.be/zPmPiS5eTxw)
audiophile,"For the longest time, I've been listening to music with my headphones. A few weeks ago, I found some old speakers I had in my basement, and I'm surprised how much I like listening to music over my speakers, despite them being old and dirt-cheap. I've decided to save up for a proper setup, but the more research I did, the most I discovered some ""hidden"" costs that comes with a proper setup. For example, on a whim I would have bought some speakers, and probably an amp and a DAC. But then I'd have to place them on my desk, which is less than ideal. If I got some speaker stands, which are more expensive than I would have imagined, I'd still have to treat my room to get the most out of my setup. Once that's done, there's probably some more stuff to do, and the cycle continues.

Long story short, once you do buy all the ""essential"" equipment like speakers, amp and a DAC, with how much time and money can you expect on average to pay on top of it to really get the most out of your setup? Of course it's not as easy as buying the 3 things, plugging them in somewhere and instantly get blown away, but are there any hidden costs you missed when you first got into building your setup? Any you would've loved to know about before starting? Any equipment you find indispensable, which just isn't considered super essential by non-audiophiles?"
audiophile,"Hello all, I have the Sony Scala Cassette Deck. Love the look, love the Dolby S and love the fact in loads in like a CD. One issue I face, however, is that seemingly at random the cassettes begin to play quite gargled.

audiophile,A few years ago I bought my first set of speakers Klipsch R41 PM. They're a pretty simple powered speaker set up and they've served me really well.

Or would I be better saving more to get a noticeable difference?

Now I‚Äôm trying to decide what Receiver will be best suited for me. I‚Äôm leaning more toward a stereo receiver but I‚Äôm trying to find a reason why an AV Receiver wouldn‚Äôt do just as well. I understand the stereo receiver is designed more for audio but with a $300 budget I feel like there won‚Äôt be enough of a sound quality difference within that price range to justify not getting more options like an AV Receiver has to offer. It would probably be more noticeable when a setup gets into the thousands of dollars but I‚Äôm unsure if it matters when comparing $300 stereo and AV Receivers. Can anyone tell me why an AV Receiver wouldn‚Äôt be best for a turntable and Tv/Xbox setup? Looking into the Denon AVR-S570BT"

audiophile,"Dolby Atmos and 360 Reality Audio from Sony have become the most popular mixing formats for Spatial music on different streaming services. Dolby is more popular and is featured on almost every major release. 360 is adapted by select record labels for a few streaming services instead of Dolby. Comparison proves to me that while 360 has its moments where it is fine, like SZA‚Äôs latest album SOS, it is blown out of the water by the expansiveness of Atmos. 360 is mixed in a spherical climate, as Atmos goes all around the head, which gives it more freedom of movement, more bass and low-end support, and less tinniness overall."

They smell like cheap blunt wraps and have the requisit water rings on top. Biggest concern is one cabinet has the top panel seams opening up, so that's going to require some careful work, but I don't suspect the X-over needing new caps yet, they still sound balanced and clear.

audiophile,"I've had my P4s for awhile connected to a different receiver working fine. The receiver was set for 8ohms so I wanted something dedicated for my vinyl/P4s. I'm not a huge audiophile, just want clean sound for the budget.

I just installed an N22 and connected to my P4s. The only input is my Denon phono.

The sound is so much cleaner than the previous amp, my only complaint is the volume is sooo low. I basically have to have the N22 volume knob turned all the way up for regular listening in my office. Even at 100% it's still underwhelming. Based on the reviews I've read this seems odd.

Do you think the previous 8ohm receiver hurt my P4s? Is the N22 just not that powerful? Seems very low for the money but I'm curious, maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about.

audiophile,"I'm trying to understand if I've got my research right for streaming Apple Music, in the highest quality to a hifi system.  I was going to ask this in the Apple Music sub, but I think I might be shot down in flames.

&amp;#x200B;

Lossless is anything above CD quality or 16bit 44.1Khz, or 1411mbps. Airplay 2 supports 16bit 44.1khz. So the best devices in the Apple ecosystem past and present are either AirPort Express 2 devices or Apple TV  or AirPort Express. I do have AE2 and they do sound great. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the current Apple ecosystem, there's nothing that goes higher unless you want the HomePod speaker setup (which I don't). To get Hi Res lossless through a hifi, I'd need to plug my MacBook or iPad directly into my Amp?

&amp;#x200B;

But, Chromecast Audio (which I had lying around) supports 24bit at 96Khz, AND the Apple Music app is available on Google Play store and will play HiRes audio (over WiFi) and supports casting to Chromecast audio. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now being honest, I'm not sure I'm one of the people who can tell the difference, but if I wanted the highest possible quality, wirelessly. Is my conclusion right that my Android phone and Chromecast are the best way to achieve it and my Mac, iPad, AE2 and Apple TV are all redundant (for this specific task)?

audiophile,"I have an Edifier R2750DB as my PC speakers and while I was done cleaning my PC and reconnecting the cables my bookshelf speakers made a clearly audible ""BRRRRR"" sound for about 5 seconds before fully inserting the cable, which I think is an electrical ground loop after some googling

&amp;#x200B;

My pc was shut off and the PSU cable was disconnected but I didn't turn off my bookshelf speakers which have their own power source

audiophile,"So I got an Audio-Technica LP 120, and I hooked it up to my edifier desktop speakers which are also plugged into my pc. I played the same track off of the PC and off the record and There is just so much static sound on the record. I tried using a Brush I thoroughly cleaned the styles and the record. My apartment does have some dust but my table has a dust cover and Its still there after I clean the record right before playing it. Could my Previous turn table ruin all my records? This has been a discouraging journey so Im open to any advice. Louder tracks are fine but softer acoustic music kinda just feels like it has a static filter on it. But even then there are noticeable pops.   


I don't think this is troubleshooting or setup its just a ""are my expectations for vinal records too high"" / am I ignoring something here"

audiophile,"Hi there. I recently bought the audio pro c10 mkII and am happy with the product. In order to get better surround sound, I'd like to buy two smaller speakers to distribute in the room. The Audio Pro lineup is pretty confusing and I'd like some help to choose the best satellite speakers. I would also consider a different brand if it is compatible with Audio Pro. We are using it in our living room which is not all that large (the c10 fills it quite well by itself).

I'm confused with the difference between the c5A and c5 mkII. Are they actually different? Does the c5A not have the most recent Bluetooth and airplay2?
There is also the c3. From the naming I would assume the c5 is better, but the pricing seems to be the same. So what's the difference between the c3 and c5?
Should I consider also the Bluetooth models like the T3 and BT5, or are these of lower quality and to be used outdoors?
What about the A series? I can't figure out the difference between these and the c-range.
Does each of these speakers connect well with my c10? Or do I need the WiFi connection instead of just bluetooth?

If anyone can answer part of these questions, I'd appreciate it."

I hear people saying that a bluetooth solution is not good. But, why? Why, if im using a service as Qobuz, for example. I mean, i get the sound from the data (through the internet), so is a file and nothing more.

So, if i have a audio solution that have bluetooth (and this ""audio solution"" is a DAC), and i send my music from the cellphone using Bluetooth (that is, a file)... to my DAC with bluetooth enable, then from the DAC through my speakers through a cable... Why this will not be a ""good"" solution?

audiophile,"I am a little bit overwhelmed about inputs on Rel t5x. Rel highly recommends for us to use the high level input for best integration with speakers. 

However I thought since powernode has a high pass filter, if I use it low response on ls50s will be relieved so they can sound better with the integration of rel t5x. And if this is the case how should set the crossover on the sub? All the way down or up. 

Should I just connect it via sub out on amp and 0.1/lfe input and set crossover from powernode or connect it via high level imput via speaker terminals?

Which should give me the best result?"
audiophile,"Hello there!

Trying to salvage my situation of having to subs murdered by a power surge, but their cones/woofers are fine. Don't want to toss them.

I've found a OSD brand external sub amplifier but it looks weak, however the terminals and all that look the same as any other amp I've seen so it makes me wonder if I can use a regular stereo or mono amp to power and then hi-pass x-over the subs manually (can't the main receiver do that too) or if it has that built in. Would be nice because it would be cheap.

Any other ideas you have, I'd love to hear!

Today I recieved and mounted an Ortofon 2M Red stylus replacing my ATN3600L. My turntable is a Technics SL-D1 running into a Pyle PP444 preamp. The signal is then sent from a preamp into my audio interface (UA VOLT276) for recording or playback through headphones/ monitors.

After setting counterweight and anti skate I played my first record as a test and found the vocals on the track sounded muffled and as if they had been soaked in reverb. I thought it could be vibrations from the speakers so I tested headphones and heard the same thing.

I have my studio desk to the right of mnp with Yamaha hs5s with an matching hs8s subwoofer. Smsl m8a dac, schiit headphone/rca amplifier that feeds into a Beringer mixer. Currently I have the sub out of the Rotel going from the receiver to my mixer so I can use the Yamaha sub. Honestly best subwoofer under $500 hands down. I'll be buying another one for movie purposes. And sell when I want to buy 2 svs subs. 

All this occurred between November and now. Running 4x cbm-170se and the matching center for 5.1 setup. Keeping the originals to be used for Dolby atmos when I get a new receiver. I don't prefer the cbms being so high but the stands don't go lower. And I'd rather have perfect listening with the svs ultras which is why they're on bottom. This also fixed the brightness of the 170's. So I may just mount the center on top the tv idk yet. Mind you the room is small. Like 16 x 9.5. and like 7-8ft ceiling. Reflections here are terrible. Speakers are 13 inches from the wall (measured from the port to wall since they are towed in). 

Short review between svs ultras and cbm-170se. 

I did a comparison sitting in a near Field equilateral triangle. 
This removes reflection bias. Without a sub svs ultras all the way. With a sub svs clearly has the better soundstage. Soundstage is night and day difference. However that means the vocal presence is more forward on the cbms-170se. (Sound strange isn't as wide so vocals will be louder) 

When watching movies ive moved both speakers all over and in the same positions. Cost wise I can't see anyone justifying buying the svs ultra at full retail for a movie setup  unless they got money and a non controlling partner, but I digress. This test was fine with svs ultras as l/r mains with the 170se and 340c(se) filling in the 5.1. spacial distance was more imersive with the left and right as ultras. But I find myself switching to the 170se left and right mains for tv/movies.  The 170se value makes no sense buying a higher end system for the purpose of movies. Music I can understand. Competive video games I can justify but not music for the price difference. But at $500 for a set of ultras that's a steal and if I can buy more at this price I will. 

If you like the 170se and want to buy them but that night and day difference imersive audio just buy some used mirage omni-polar speakers. Nano SATs or the towers. Nothing comes close to them when playing call of duty. 

If you guys want an in depth comparison or want my hearing test results let me know and I'll make a YouTube video."

audiophile,"Hi everybody,  
I've been lurking over here in the last decade, this is my first post.

I have zero knowledge of acoustical engineering but I like listening to music. Sorry if this is the wrong section: I wanted to be sure this is a problem before ask for help in [Audiophile Helpdesk](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/10j21um/raudiophile_shopping_setup_and_technical_help/).

I just bought a used [Rotel A10](https://www.rotel.com/en-gb/product/a10) (not a [RA-10](https://www.rotel.com/en-gb/product/ra-10)) but I didn't hear the clarity I was expecting so I was wondering if is it normal for an integrated amp to have all grounds connected together? Like [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_BL-okoeHiUgIeOWmVgCbAmEzWdRfzU/view)?

It seems that every ground is connected together: the outer ring of RCAs signal inputs, the black pole of speaker power cables, the phono ground, the screws, but not the double insulated chassis.

Also when you put a pair of RCAs in one input, you can hear the same signal, much attenuated, when you switch to ANY other inputs but phono.

I am ashamed of my ignorance, but is this behaviour normal? It doesn't sounds normal to me but I may be wrong. 

Is it a defective unit, am I missing something or it's just how it's supposed to normally work?"

audiophile,"When reading about 70‚Äôs receivers there appears to be a lot about wattage, but less about this difference in their phono stage and tuner quality. 

How different is the phono stage and tuner among the different Pioneer SX-*50 receivers? Is the difference between a 750 and 1250 just the amount of power produced by the amp, or are you getting a better sounding pre and tuner with the power upgrade?

Same question for the Yamaha CR-*00 receivers. If you don‚Äôt need much power, should you even entertain spending more if you can get a CR-400 on the cheap?

audiophile,"Up until December, my front end had been a 2015 MacBook Pro &gt; USB &gt; Anthem STR integrated. The MBP was getting a bit old in the tooth so upgraded to a 2021 M1.

I tend to rotate speakers and mess with placement quite often. When I'm setting up new speakers, quickest way to bypass any speaker/distance/levels/room correction, etc. is to run the amp in bypass mode with headphone out from the MacBook to RCA input, controlling the volume digitally from the audio player. With the new MacBook I was hearing so much more detail and clarity than I remember with the old one, all other \[controllable\] variables being the same.

Did a little searching and Apple did make a hardware change that I'm thinking is the reason:

&gt;The 3.5 mm headphone jack on compatible Mac computers¬†features¬†DC load detection and adaptive voltage output. Your Mac¬†can detect the impedance of the connected device and will adapt its output¬†for low- and high-impedance headphones, as well as for¬†line-level audio devices.  
&gt;  
&gt;When you connect headphones with an impedance of less than 150 ohms, the headphone jack provides up to 1.25 volts RMS. **For headphones with an impedance of 150 to 1k ohms,¬†the headphone jack delivers 3 volts RMS.** This may remove the need for an external headphone amplifier.  
&gt;  
&gt;With¬†impedance detection, adaptive voltage output, and [a built-in digital-to-analog converter](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212854) that supports sample rates of up to 96 kHz, you can enjoy high-fidelity, full-resolution audio directly from the headphone jack on your Mac.

Would this work for more than headphones? I'm guessing the input impedance on the amp would be high enough to trigger the higher 3 volt RMS output. Regardless, this is genuinely high-fidelity sound and a big enough improvement to make me question the built in preamp section of the integrated.

Anyone else experience this? Any other explanations for what I might be experiencing? Is this better impedance matching? Shorter single path? Less noise?"

Now I'm at a spot where I assume I'm like 95-98% there when it comes to toe in, but wondered what I should be looking for if/when I overdo the toe-in.

Is it simply just ""last toe in sounded better so now I overdid it"" or are there any signs I should look for? Same for rake, that I have very little understanding still, tried raking the speaker up and down and noticed that the vocals don't really change position on my speakers (Amphion Helium 3) but the presentation definitely changes somehow, still can't really describe it. Is there something else besides vocal height to look for with the rake angle to give me some guidelines on when I overdo it?"

audiophile,"I've made a full circle. From a big full hi-fi stack with floor speakers I've had at my parent's home, to my student-Pianocraft mini-hifi tower that I was ferrying around between apartments for years, to finally this budget minimalistic setup. And I couldn't be more happy with it. 

I really love that I can stream music from Tidal with it, but I also wanted something more hands-on, that would scratch my music collecting itch, so for the first time I've got me a turntable. Well, the most basic recommended one, but still I love it :) It's really mesmerizing that you can see all the inner workings while the music plays, see how the platter rotates, how the stylus comes closer and closer to the end of the record. Crazy, I'm listening to music for so many years and never thought this visual stimulus would add so much to the experience. 

I wanted to thank you guys, because it was this reddit, among others, that inspired me to consider a turntable and powered speakers as an option."

audiophile,"Found this Pioneer 4 Channel Power Amplifier model QM-800A and strangely it did not have a bottom metal plate nor wood top and has a battleship style CRT on the right.  At first it looked like a custom hack job but the back plate has ports for the CRT so it seems like a genuine build.  The other strange thing is there is no SERIAL NUMBER that I can see.  Although I don't know how to connect this to the Pioneer TX-1000 tuner and speakers I have, it seems to work and the CRT lights up with a green dot that can be centered using the controls on the right.   The knob on the far right controls the intensity of the green dot.  I'm not a collector so will list this on Ebay to see what happens.  When I print the QM-800A User's Manual, there is no mention of a CRT.  It's all very unique.   The estate sale where this came from was home to a mid-century electronics Guru with Oscilloscopes and all but it seemed this was not in current use.  There was also a preamplifier model QC-800A but that clearly was modified           with some add-on board.   I wonder if this guy worked for Pioneer back in the day."

audiophile,"Greetings all,

I come from a background of car audio so I'm no stranger so speakers and amplifiers. In the mobile world, especially when it comes to subwoofers, we like to never provide *less* than recommended power, and usually prefer more than recommended due to subwoofers (of high quality) incredible ability to just take more and more. I learned quite young that this is *not* the case with high quality home speakers...

I have spent so much money on my cars' audio but due to living arrangements I haven't bothered to fill my living space with sound, until now. I'm about to pull the trigger on some Kef Q150 bookshelfs (and SVS sub), my first ""real"" speakers, though I grew up with a Klipsch-obsessed father. He is disappoint that I do not buy Klipsch. I digress. The Q150's are rated 10-100w RMS at 8 ohms. This seems like a pretty wide range of power. Considering the low 86dB sensitivity, how close do I need to get to 100w RMS? We all know 100 watts out of a receiver is *not* the same thing as 100 watts out of an amplifier, and I'm finding that 100 watts out of an amplifier is going to cost me more than double the speakers. Which I totally understand, same thing in cars sometimes. 

However, how much power would one recommend for some speakers requesting 100w? Insufficient power makes car subwoofers sound horrible. What if I put 65w on these? 50w? Keep in mind I need them to keep up with a PB-2000 subwoofer. My current system is Polk Audio M20 tower speakers and Sony STR- DG720 receiver so like literally anything is going to be better. I'm not hating on Polk, I actually love them but it has been a long time and I've never had *nice* stuff :) Thanks in advance!

audiophile,"Hi all,

I've always enjoyed listening to music, specifically vinyl, and have what I consider a great budget setup. Polk 7as driven by an older Denon receiver in my living room, and Polk 5jrs also driven by an older Denon receiver in my office.  To my ears, they both sound great for casual listening.

I have Spotify premium and like having the ability to stream music on my main, living room listening setup.  As it stands right now, I have a cheap-o bluetooth dongle going straight into one of the receivers inputs, and that is it. Yes, I am aware that there is no possible way this is producing good audio quality.

I've read a lot of posts on here about maximizing a streaming setup but am still somewhat confused.  Some questions I have:

* What budget device/dongle is best for streaming high-quality Spotify on a home receiver? I think some on this forum have said have sad that Chromecast Audio allows for this. 
* If a get a streaming device that preserves the quality of Spotify premium, do I then need to run this device into a DAC to get best possible quality? I am new to the world of DACs and do not yet own one
* If going wired, if I take the aux out from my phone or laptop and go straight into my receiver while streaming Spotify, i'll technically have high quality audio but may be suffering from the inferior, built-in DAC of my phone or computer, correct?  
* Could I do phone/computer -&gt; DAC -&gt; receiver and maintain decent audio quality?
* Are there any bluetooth options that could be controlled from my phone/computer and go straight into my receiver, or are all the best options operating over wi-fi on Spotify connect?

Just a quick question / hoping someone can check out something on their own high-end speaker setup and confirm something for me.  

I feel like I've been noticing a slight bit of noise / crackle when listening to music through Spotify today and have managed to find a specific part of a song that seems to have it pretty bad.  

I'm hoping someone can also listen to this particular song on their own setup and see if they hear a crackle. Perhaps it's just part of the way the song was mixed or something.

Is this possible?"
audiophile,"To the pro audio guys

given that you use a subwoofer crossed at 80hz; will a 12 play any louder than a 8? 

The way I see it, spl is all about air movement. If you cross the signal at 80hz, the tweeter of a 12‚Äô‚Äô top speaker should fail way before the woofer since the cone of the woofer wont move much if crossed at 80hz, the woofer wont overheat either since the power demand above 80hz is small relative to below 80hz. 

This brings me to 8‚Äô‚Äô top speakers. If their tweeter is equal to a 12‚Äô‚Äô, and the top speaker is crossed at 80hz, i think they should be able to keep up, what do you guys think? Are 12‚Äô‚Äô with subwoofer waste of space, money and weight?"

I‚Äôd like to know the opinion of those who own MacBook M1 pro/max as they‚Äôre first models to get built-in DAC.  But not only that. The main thing is as usual in comparison: ‚Äúhow is it comparing to X?‚Äù 

So I will start from Schiit Fulla 2 as I own one. It is a very basic one, I know, It makes no miracles. But it works. 

Does anyone have the experience of listening music from laptop+Fulla and MacPro with built in DAC ? 

I‚Äôm curious. If newest MacPro built in DAC is same level or close to Fulla then its already good news I guess. For everyday use its more then OK. 

I have listening experience of Bifrost 2, makes no sense to compare it with Mac obviously. But Fulla - I think its appropriate comparison.

audiophile,"The title says it all really. I'm slowly building a system, I have an unboxed pair of Kef LS50 Metas and I'm about to buy the KC62 subwoofer. I'm 99% certain I want the Lyngdorf TDAI 1120 to power these speakers, and I want to use Roon, preferably via an iPad remote. Would this setup require an additional Roon core, or does the TDAI take care of all of that?"
audiophile,"I had some Klipsch KLF-10s hooked up to an older (1990s?) Pioneer Elite integrated amp and a Pro-ject Debut Carbon. The sound was just **fun**. I would put on Earth Wind and Fire's Serpentine Fire and it was just full and bouncy and wonderful.

Then the Pioneer died and I upgraded to a Rega Elex-R integrated amp, and all the fullness and bounce and kick seems to be gone. Of course, I listen to many other things besides funk‚Äì‚Äìmostly classical, post-rock, minimalism, thick vocal things (like Jacob Collier), and the clarity that the Rega gets is better; but I miss the fun of the old setup. 

Is this normal? Why was this older setup so much more wonderful sloppy fun? Does the upward ascent (in price) mean generally cleaner sounds at the expense of fullness?"
audiophile,"I want to edit out skits from my music so I can just get right to the music and I've been using Audacity to do this. However, when you edit a track in Audacity, the only way (at least, the only way I'm aware of) of saving the edits is to make a new file, so it encodes a FLAC from my FLAC. Is this an issue? I'm just about to start ripping CDs so I'm wondering if it might make more sense to rip to WAV, make my edits, and then have Audacity export to FLAC when I save.

Also, if anyone knows of an editing program that just saves the edits rather than needing to create a whole new file, please let me know."
audiophile,"Does it affect the sound quality? I'm getting the HE400SE headphones soon and I'm going to be playing sound primarily through my phone. The quality of the audio won't be affected, right?"
audiophile,"So to make a long story short I love me some good quality audio. I got into using DSP about 2 or so years ago and while I initially loved it over the past few months I kinda regret buying a miniDSP 4X2HD for my setup. My current main audio setup is at my computer desk. I've got a nice 2.1 setup that's mainly driven from a miniDSP 4X2HD. Originally I used USB for the audio as it was convenient and high quality and worked reliably... keyword here is worked. At some point I had my motherboard die. It was an MSI X570-A Pro and it was a great board. Everything worked fine until I replaced the board with a more expensive one from ASUS. After doing so my miniDSP 4X2HD refused to work at all via USB. The driver can't find the device and Windows reports an error ""USB device descriptor error"" and then the device refuses to work. So fearing the worst I assumed there was a hardware failure so I contacted miniDSP and shipped my unit to them in Hong Kong for testing. They reported that the device was working as expected and even was nice enough to share some test results with me that confirmed that the device was in fact working. After receiving the unit back I plugged it in and found out that yet again it didn't work. i tried another PC I had and it worked as expected. So I contacted ASUS about this issue and to make a long story short It's been roughly 2-3 months since I started having this issue and both miniDSP and ASUS both kinda put their hands up and say they don't know what the issue is. ASUS claims they are working on the issue behind the scenes but all I get is the same email back week after week saying ""we appreciate your time and we are working with our higher up technical staff to address the issue"". I'm basically forced to have 2 computers now. One for my regular everyday use and a second just for my DSP. It's a bit absurd. I'm 99% sure the issue is related to the motherboard miscommunicating with the DSP but this can happen to anybody with any hardware combo.  


In the end I'm not sure if I can recommend these products to anyone given how unreliable they seem to be. I've also had other issues with the DSP such as it forcing you to factory reset the device settings if you dare to plug it into another PC instead of reading the config from the device and uploading it to the software. It also cracks and pops when someone turns off the bathroom fan as the power supply is incapable of filtering out spikes in voltage. This sometimes even causes the device to lock up and I have to unplug the device to reset it. While the audio quality and overall functionality is great I'm not entirely happy with the product and would advice others to look around for other options. I paid nearly 300$ for this unit and only got maybe 2 years of use out of it before it stopped working. Even now it sometimes randomly won't communicate with other PCs I have and I have to repower it.  


Feel free to tell me i'm an idiot for having an opinion or share yours below. I'd love to hear your take."
audiophile,"Hey there,  
maybe this question is dumb, but can I use my ES100 as a DAC for the JBLs with a 3.5 mm TS to 1/4"" TS cable and make them ""wireless""?  
Does the amp inside the ES100 somehow feed power to the JBLs and I risk damaging them?  
  
What can I expect sound quality wise?

audiophile,I am interested in a higher quality listening experience that is able to connect to my phone as I listen to music a lot on the go.

audiophile,"I've only recently started thinking about this, and reading this forum, so please excuse some silly questions - a lot of the knowledge I had when I first bought my system 17 years ago seems to have disappeared from my memory bank.

My original 5.1 system (bought 17 years ago) comprises of;
 - Arcam Movie Solo 5.1
 - Monitor Audio Radius 225(C), 90(RL) and 45(rears)
 - REL Quake sub

This was set up in a house where I was living at the time, my parents now live there and I've moved out. 

That system even to this day is a thoroughly enjoyable setup and works amazingly well for us (about 75% HT, 25% Music). 

That's my background from a system I set many many years ago.  I now want to think of another system for myself. At the time the Arcam cost me ¬£2000, and currently I'm thinking of spending around ¬£3k on an AVR. 

My issue is back then things were a lot simpler. Nowadays there is so much happening and I'm a little confused as to what is important and what isn't. 

My reasoning behind wanting to spend so much on an AVR is I want to buy once and that's it. And I want one that is GOOD quality, and can drive whichever speaker I throw at it. 

I will be wanting at the very minimum a 5.1.2, but I want the ability to be able to upgrade to 7.1.4 should I ever have the desire, without having to upgrade my AVR. The AVR should have lots left in reserve - I've always been of the mindset to buy quality.

Brand wise I like Arcam since I have a good experience with it. I understand Marantz, Anthem and Emotiva can complete with it at that price bracket? Any others?

Can someone please help me out here a to which AVR I should consider? Or perhaps throw questions at me to help guide me as to what I should be looking at?

As far as speakers go, I'm still looking at Monitor Audio (again because of my experience with them), but the Silver 7G range as opposed to the Radius range this time. 

Please keep in mind I'm in the UK.

Thanks in advance."

audiophile,"I'm trying to set up a 2.1 system but not very sure how to get some demo experience before finding the right one for me.

Also, if possible to check out some integrated amp too. Are there any shops in SoCal who have some wide range of demo setups. If possible I would also love to listen to some of the most expensive ones too just to keep as reference."

audiophile," I have a set of yamaha NX-N500 speakers which I love. I have them on a book shelf about 6 feet apart and 6 feet away from me.

To me, the Yamaha speakers make it sound like the music isn't coming from a speaker, but like the music is coming from a musician in the room with you (as long as you're not playing something too bass heavy) - the speakers ""disappear"".

I tried placing the yamaha speakers on my desk (literally an arms length away) - they didn't sound as good as on the bookshelf, and they're just too large for a desk.

I have tired the following speakers an arms length away on my desk: iloud micros, audioengine a2, kanto yu4. All these speakers ¬†sound alright, but they sound like speakers - they don't have that same effect of making it sound like the musician is in the room , as with the yamaha nx-n500 when they're on the bookshelf.

If I get a pair of high end monitors, like the neumann kh-80 or the focal shape 40 (I don't want anything bigger than this for my desk), would they have the same affect at an arms length as the yamaha nx-n500's ont he bookshelf? That is would the nuemann's make it sound like the music is coming from a musician actually in the room, rather than a speaker?"
audiophile,"I've been into the ""audiophile"" world for a couple of years now. I started out with a humble Schiit Modi, Vali 2+, and Sennheiser HD6XX, and I then eventually upgraded to a Schiit Gungnir MB, Schiit Mjolnir 2 (with a variety of 6922 tube rolling), and Focal Clear OG.

I remember reading some posts a while ago on head-fi and reddit describing the progression of the audiophile life. While I'm paraphrasing, these posts generally went something along the lines of ""(1) I know everything about headphones/DACs/AMPs now (2) then wow, I actually know nothing at all about headphones/DACs/AMPs after all (3) then okay, after a great deal of experience, I have eventually reached contentment"".

I've recently been out of town for a couple weeks and went back to my original setup (Modi, Vali, HD6XX) and have realized that I may enjoy this setup more than the much more expensive equipment I have been using for the past year. While fully acknowledging the technical superiority of the Gungnir, Mjolnir, and Focal Clear combo in every way (better detail retrieval, macro/microdynamics, soundstage/imaging, bass), there's still something so alluring about the timbre and smoothness and richness of the much cheaper HD6XX combo.

Anyhow, I feel like I've now advanced to stage 2 of the audiophile life experience, where I yet again know nothing. I'm now very much doubting my initial belief that more money and more detail retrieval = better. The way the music makes me feel is so very important, regardless of the technical prowess of any particular setup. This was initially lost on me after I started going down the audiophile rabbit hole, chasing the ultimate technicalities. I hope to eventually reach stage 3 (contentment). I now feel like I'm on my way!  

I just felt like sharing my thoughts. I wish everyone the best in this crazy audiophile/headphone journey."
audiophile,"Sorry if this is a newbie question. I want to clarify a something regarding my setup.

I have a Cambridge Audio AXR100 amp (100 Watts into 8ohms) and have Elac Debut 2.0 B6.2 speakers (6ohm 120W max). On the rear of the amp, it says 4-8ohm The amp has A/B speaker selection and obviously the option of A+B.

The Cambridge manual states ""when using two pairs of speakers, use speakers with a nominal impedance of 8 ohms each).

I want to add outdoor speakers to the B connections but feel that this is unsafe unless I refrain from outputting to both A &amp; B? Can anyone confirm this? My goal is to be able to have either and both pairs of speakers running.

Is my only real option to buy some 8ohm speakers for both inside and out, or a separate amp to run the outdoor speakers?"

audiophile," Hello!  


This is my first audiophile post was curious on the best path forward with my future plans. I just bought some ascend acoustics tower [speakers](https://ascendacoustics.com/collections/sierra-series-pairs/products/sierra-tower-v2-pair?variant=40596422656054) to fill up my two story 1600SQFT condo. These towers will ideally be for critical listening as well as for watching movies (50%/50%). My condo has vaulted ceilings and I am about 13 feet away from the speakers when sitting on my couch. I plan to one day upgrade to a 5.1 surround system in a year or two, but I want to build towards a quality 2.0 system first.  


Originally I had bought a NAD M33 and was pretty happy with it, but I realized that there is no way to match them up to a receiver in the future because it does not have passthrough. I have read the forums noting of hacks to combine an AVR with it, but it will need delay relays to delay the sounds to the other speakers and it just all seems rather complex to integrate. The way I see it, I can do a couple things:  


1. Buy streamer(node) + dac(schitt modius) + preamp(freya S) + amp (buckeye stereo purifi) separates. When it comes time to integrate an AVR, I can just add in a balanced audio [switch¬†](https://www.amazon.com/Balanced-Audio-Switcher-Passive-Splitter/dp/B07THHFJMT?th=1)to the AMP and I switch it over if I want to move to Movie mode.  


2. Buy a integrated streamer/dac/preamp (matrix audio m2 is top choice) + amp (buckeye stereo purifi). Again, I can buy an audio switch when the time is right.  


3. Buy an integrated amp with pass through, but nothing tested by ASR so far has enough wattage (&gt;150) or high enough SINAD(&gt;100) to merit this.  


4. Just buy an AVR now (Marantz Cinema 40) and just use the stereo speakers and build slowly from there.  


Are there any other options I'm missing? I am assuming 1 is very complex, 3 won't be satisfactory, and 4 will just be overkill for now. Thoughts?  


Extraneous information that may be useful:  


\- I might want to add a subwoofer for 2.1 listening sooner  
\- I have an HTPC for watching 4k movies. I plan to also use this for dirac when I want to do more critical listening within the room  


Thank you!"
audiophile,"I recently learned that you can use the ""- cutoff"" command for FDKAAC as well, and I started playing with it, eventually maxing it out with a value of 20KHz.

I noticed that the sound is a bit fuller, as opposed to the standard 17KHz cutoff, but I am not sure whether this is placebo or not.

Does anyone have an objective answer as to whether the higher cutoff frequency improves the sound quality of the compressed audio file? Also, are there any drawbacks in increasing it?"

On the sonos app set the line out to ‚Äúdual mono‚Äù and plug one of the RCA cables into the port‚Äôs line out and the 1/8‚Äù cable into the FAV-LE‚Äôs line in. You should be able to play the Sonos Port through the FAV-LE visualizer at the same time as your other Sonos devices to get all the power of your system along with the visualization provided by the FAV-LE. The trick, same as previously not using the Sonos, is getting the volume correct.

audiophile,"I have been shopping for a new pair of speakers and for some reason Triangle has been calling me. I am also looking at Revel, Focal, and KEF speakers as I would like something front ported, or non rear ported due to room limitations. People have been saying to invest in the speakers and build the rest after you have those decided, but I foolishly just got the Marantz PM7000n amp, and now I want to upgrade the speakers. Maybe foolish isn't the word as I really like it, but I want to make sure it can handle the next set of speakers which are coming soon and I hope to keep them for a long time.

The Borea BR09 are easily in my price range and I am looking at the Focal Chora 826, potentially Aria 926, KEF Q950, and trying to find a place to listen to Revel here in town. My question for people is will the Marantz handle the needs of any of these brands better than others?

Once I listen to a few brands I will make a decision, but as I have the opportunity to get my hands on a limited edition I am thinking that if I really like the Triangle sound I will try to pull the trigger on these if I like them. They have been online for a few months and the photos look good, I just want to know if it is worth it to go 3 hours away and figure out transport.

So basically my price range is near the 2500 euro mark. Also was looking at Polk R700, but I read that axr100 would be too weak as an amplifier for those speakers.

audiophile,"[I listened to a pair of Wilson Chronosonic XVX \($400k\) speakers for fun at a dealer the other month.](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/zz2u9k/my_new_reference/) My test track was *Parabola* by Tool. And the part that is seared into my brain is how mind bogglingly tall the soundstage was. The toms and snares of the drum kit are all on one level and the kick drum was so well located and defined beneath it. [Visual explanation- kick drum in red](https://imgur.com/a/eRJQAok). When I listen to my speakers at home (Philharmonic BMR towers), the kick drum bleeds into the same level as the toms and snares.

Is this impression entirely due to the room the dealer had set up (15' ceilings, room treatment, and speakers on the long wall) and/or the configuration of the speaker itself? Is it as simple as a 7 foot tall speaker projects a 7 foot tall soundstage?

I'll likely never be able to spend that astronomical sum of money on speakers (never say never haha). So I'm asking from a place of wanting to know more about speaker design. And how certain designs increase or decrease vertical soundstage.

-----------------

I asked Dennis Murphy (guy who designs Philharmonic speakers) about this and he had this to say:

&gt; Imaging height is not well understood and real-world experience tends to be counter-intuitive.   It's not just a matter of vertical dispersion and seems to depend more on horizontal dispersion.  The BMR tower has fairly limited vertical dispersion, which is part of the design goal of an MTM configuration.  That's also true of the Wilson you heard, which has an MtmM configuration.  The smaller midrange unit will provide broad horizontal dispersion, but the larger midranges that flank the tweeter and small mid will cancel each other as you move vertically above the speaker.  So I'm quite confident that what you heard is not due to exceptionally wide vertical dispersion.  It may just be a consequence of the height of the speaker, which is slightly taller than the Chrysler Building."

I'm currently choosing between Edifier M206 BT, LG LK72B, or Edifier 1080BT.

I don't want to be limited at bass that is why I'm currently leaning towards Edifier M206BT, and also heard that LG LK72B satellite speakers are trash. Please help.

I have a question about apple music vs spotify. 
I use big audio systems for venues and wired in ears. 
I was wondering if its worth it to upgrade to apple music. 
Is it noticable?"
audiophile,"*Hoping this post can help people like me who enjoy good quality but don't have infinite storage.*

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR ‚Üí AAC 320kbps offers files ‚âà40% the size of FLACs for roughly the same amount of data.**

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking at the technical side of music encoding, going through the specifications of MP3, AAC, FLAC, WAV, DSD, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

During my research, I found that properly encoding AAC at a 320kbps bitrate from FLAC (or other lossless formats) allows to **keep an incredible amount of data compared to the size**.

&amp;#x200B;

Have a look at the spectrograms of every format:

&amp;#x200B;

[16bit 44.1Hz FLAC - 20.9 MB](https://preview.redd.it/6qqd2lzomzda1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=58270203cfc5574789a103fabf2a9f8fc227f53e)

[320kbps AAC - 8.2 MB](https://preview.redd.it/i8ym4anrmzda1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f7b3083963cfc2df526120cb50968e9b4da8f56b)

[320kbps MP3 - 8.5 MB](https://preview.redd.it/wwdb1qwtmzda1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1851269d62d96f7f770527f6ddac4667e8c3016c)

[128kbps MP3 - 3.5 MB](https://preview.redd.it/qwpzgd5vmzda1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c0b4dbf53d2c9b51a46d8120a0a89e6e4c2658a0)

&amp;#x200B;

All the lossy files have been encoded directly from the FLAC file with FFMPEG (see commands at the end of the post).

&amp;#x200B;

We notice a huge drop in size:

* **320kbps AAC**: 39% of the FLAC file size
* **320kbps MP3**: 40% of the FLAC file size
* **128kbps MP3**: 17% of the FLAC file size

&amp;#x200B;

Without surprise, the MP3 sacrifices much of the quality during compression, but AAC 320 is almost identical to FLAC **and** offers a file even lighter than MP3 320!

&amp;#x200B;

**In conclusion, if you don't have terabytes of space available but still want to enjoy good quality music, AAC 320 is your go-to, I now only use this format to constitute my music library.**

&amp;#x200B;

Commands used:

* **AAC 320kbps**: `ffmpeg -i ""$i"" -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 320k ""${i%.flac}"".m4a`
* **MP3 320kbps**: `ffmpeg -i ""$i"" -c:v copy -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k ""${i%.flac}"".mp3`
* **MP3 128kbps**: `ffmpeg -i ""$i"" -c:v copy -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k ""${i%.flac}"".mp3`"

Would you guys go with one big AVR like the Marantz SR-7015 for both 5.1 AND stereo listening or would you go with a double setup like a Marantz PM7000N and a Marantz NR-1711. The latter should sound better right? The stereo PM7000N doesn't seem to have home theater bypass input, could this be an issue? If yes why and what equipment would you pick?

I've done some research and seems like the PM8005 would do the trick just fine, but because it is old, I'm not certain the quality would be as good as the PM7000N.

Perhaps another brand for the same budget would offer everything?"

Hi all,

Still having doubts whether or not to upgrade to the Arendal 1723 1s. Currently my Arendal 1961 1s subwoofer is plenty loud en musical enough combined with the Kef R11 and easily reach 20hz 100db at my listening position.

audiophile,"Just had a crazy experience after getting my Wiim Mini streamer in the mail. I did an A/B test with spotify connected directly to my $200 amp via bluetooth, then streaming spotify to the Wiim Mini, through my DAC and into the amp.

All I can say is WOW.

The difference between bluetooth and streaming is incredible. I used a Lil Uzi Vert song as one of the tests and it went from 2D and symmetrical with bluetooth, to 3D, spacious, and asymmetrical (different sounds coming from different places; much better stereo imaging). The difference was incredible.

Whenever I see people posting about these types experiences I'm always critical. That was because I never experienced such a drastic change before but wow this was insane.

Now, another thing. The difference between bluetooth and streaming for me was instantly noticeable and dare I say day and night. But I have yet to hear any difference between Spotify streaming through my Wiim (320kbps) and CDs going through my CD player, through the same DAC into my amp...

At what point of breaking up the frequencies do you get diminishing returns?  Would a good 3 way speaker crossover be significantly outperformed by, say, a 10 way setup?  How wide of a range can a driver accurately reproduce sound before it loses fidelity? 

To be more specific, if instead of driving a single mid speaker for like 250hz to 2khz (or however it would be split - am noob), would there be significant benefit to instead using 3 different mid range channels: 250hz to 500hz, 500hz to 1khz, and 1khz to 2khz?   Or would something like that be a bit overkill?

audiophile,"Amazon and other vendors have figured out they can take aluminum wire, plate it in copper, and sell it as ""speaker cable."" The more honest vendors label this ""copper clad aluminum."" Its electrical properties are much closer to aluminum than copper: it's much more resistive than copper, it's much lighter, and it's more fragile: aluminum becomes more and more brittle as it flexes over time.

Copper is better than aluminum in every way. All the old rules of thumb concerning what's a good gauge of speaker wire for a given run assume copper wire; they will be wrong for aluminum wire.

I still have my reel of Amazon Basics speaker cable, whose packaging doesn't mention the material. Of course it *looks* like copper behind the clear insulation. Since speaker cable is traditionally stranded 100% copper, they clearly intend to mislead consumers who assume they are getting standard copper wire. It's misleading to the point of bordering on fraud.

So I've been running aluminum wire in my main and secondary systems and some systems that I've set up for family for most of the last decade and realized it only today when I went shopping for another reel and learned all this.

Caveat emptor for Amazon goods especially. Jeff Bezos is a real D-bag!"
audiophile,Recently bought a Rega Planar 1 and looking to pair it with best speakers in that range. Thanks!
audiophile,"I've still got a quite basic Yamaha Amp, so what should I go for in the same price range as the speakers?"
audiophile,"Hi all, idiot here. 

I thought you might find these images interesting to look through.. and I would appreciate advice if you have any to give. 

This is a 5.1.2 system (sub and ceiling speakers are not pictured.) MA bronze 200's in the front, bronze 50's on the sides/rear for surrounds, bronze C150 in the center. The ceiling speakers are C165's and suffered zero damage, as well as the W10 sub - no issues there. System is driven through a Yamaha RX-A4A receiver, with the front L/R driven through an older QSC amp. This system has been awesome - sounds great, gets loud, very immersive. Ive been quite happy with it. 

Long story short, pushed the system a 'bit' too hard and ended up with this. The right surround is done for.. the cone is cracked though all the way and will need to be replaced. You can still however move it in and out with no scraping, noise, or resistance.. so I imagine the coil is more or less ok. Probably would still replace the whole driver. The left surround is not in great shape either, but much better off than the right. I am wondering if I can re-cone/foam it and be ok.. or if I need to replace the whole driver as well. 

The front channels show some signs of damage - really just a couple of pressure points around the edges of the cones. You'll see those as well. I don't \*think\* anything needs to be done here but I am interested to hear your feedback. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know your thoughts.. Curious to see what you think.

audiophile,My charge 5 has static humming at low volumes and when I pause the music it continues for about 3-5 seconds and then stops. It comes back on immediately when I turn on the music again. Is this normal?
audiophile,I know break in something that can possibly help me but the difference right now is honestly huge. My old PC speakers are Logitech Z523 and they sound much more full and rich than the wharfedales when coming from the same source. I heard the Wharfedale speakers are supposed to sound a little more distant? I‚Äôve tried all the connections and sources and it seems that the speakers themselves are the only thing that could be the problem. Has anyone had this problem before or is it likely a problem with these individual speakers? Thank you

- You can create several folders with playlists in each folder

- You can use them with both wired AND wireless earphones

- You can download YouTube videos onto them (with the yt to mp3 conversations sites)

Is it a good piece or crap? Otherwise my setup is Marantz M-CR510 + two Wharfedale Diamond 10.1. I know it's not any special, but my goal was to substitute my Harman Kardon Onyx Studio for something better, being smart enough to integrate into Home Assistant and it is perfectly achieved."
audiophile,"Is anyone out there using Dirac? I‚Äôm looking into getting a minidsp flex and running Dirac for the room corrections.

Current system is Wiim mini (mainly tidal)&gt; Cambridge audio CXA81 &gt; Dali Oberon 5

Seems like the flex would just replace the dac in the cxa81. The Cambridge doesn‚Äôt have a tape loop. 

I also have a systemdek IIX turntable. I was thinking about running the systemdek through Dirac too. I know I would have to go AD then DA‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt want to stop listening to records because it sounds way worse than streaming (because of the lack of room correction rather than getting into a discussion about streaming vs records). I have an outboard rega phono preamp.

2.  Sending a turntable through dsp. I know this might anger some people, but is there anyone out there doing it?"

audiophile,"Just upgraded my headphones and I chose these cans due to numerous positive online reviews. I'm glad I did.

The detail, presence and solid, but not muddy, bass, is impressive. They are sturdy, but lightweight, and are very comfortable (the latest version comes with velour wrapped ear pads, not pleather).

I bought the 32 ohm version (also available in 80 &amp; 250 ohm) and they are easily driven by my iPhone and iPad, but I am awaiting a Qudelix 5K DAC/amp that should bring them to the next level. 

BTW- the Apple USB-C (or Lightning) to 3.5mm headphone jack is an amazing little dongle. It boosts volume and has a decent DAC for $9...

audiophile,"Hello,

I am trying to find a subwoofer to pair with a 3020 or 3030 which I will soon purchase. 

The speakers will be used as Desktop PC speakers over optical with 70% of the time being used for music from Tidal (electronic, drums and bass, etc), 10% games and 10% podcast/ YouTube videos.

I am currently running a 10‚Äô sub from my old Logitech Z5500 which I am very happy with and gets nice and deep/ punchy in music and games. I use subwoofer gain on my sound card and that helps greatly. The sub has served me well for over a decade but I thought moving to the 3020/3030s should offer a decent upgrade. 

Purchasing a new sub to pair with the above, my number one priority is not wanting a downgrade from my current 10‚Äô sub experience.

The two options I had in mind are Q3060s and QB12, both currently on sale. I understand they are vastly different models. 

I was initially going to go with the Q3060s but a little worried it will be a downgrade from my 10‚Äô and less punchy. Form factor is perfect but punchiness and depth I‚Äôm worried about. There is also NO reviews on this item at all‚Ä¶

The QB12 sub is BIG and feels overkill for a PC setup and will be hard to fit under my desk. Reviews also state for this sub doesn‚Äôt get as deep as it should for its size.

What would be a good recommendation from the above. Both the 3060s and QB12 are currently 30% off RRP in my region and match the 3020/3030 aesthetically, so that‚Äôs why I have my eye on them. 

I can‚Äôt find any reviews on the Q3060s and I also read somewhere the QB12 has issues at low frequencies but couldn‚Äôt find more info on this. 

Here is my current system:

audiophile,"I'm currently using a MiniDSP SHD as a preamplifier. I chose this preamp because it allows me to take Dirac measurements, set crossover points, and it has 4 outputs, which makes it very easy to connect my sub. It also has digital outs so that I can connect it to a DAC nicer than the DAC on the MiniDSP. 

Unfortunately, this MiniDSP SHD is slowly started to die and I trying to find a way to use my other gear to achieve the same objectives. The best candidate I have is a Cambridge CXN v2. The downside is that it only has 2 outputs (no sub output) and it does not include Dirac either.

I'm an avid Roon user. I'm wondering if anyone has experiencing applying Dirac measurements and applying them to Roon filters? If I'm able to do this, I have solved the Dirac issue. I love the corrections Dirac applied to my Roon and I'd like to keep them.

As for the subwoofer, I'd rather not plug the Cambridge CXN outputs to the subwoofer inputs and then the subwooder outputs to my power amplifier.. the location of the sub would make this difficult. Open to suggestions on this issue as well.

audiophile,"I currently have a 5.1 setup but I want to get an amplifier to also have the choice of 2.1 for music using the same fronts and sub.

I am currently running a Denon x3700h, Polk Legend L800's for my front L/R, Polk Legend L400 for my center, Legend L100's for my surrounds, and SVS SB3000 for my sub. I've been looking at getting a Marantz Model 30 amp. However, my understanding is that if I use the hometheater bypass, my subwoofer would not play during music. If I used the preouts from my avr to the power amp in on the Model 30, I would be essentially wasting the preamp of the Model 30 (which i assume is far superior to the processing that the avr is doing for music?).
I want to know if there is any reasonable way to use my L/R/sub as part of both a 5.1 system and 2.1 system:

-without having to mess with unplugging things every time I want to use them

-without bypassing my subwoofer

-without bypassing the preamp portion of the integrated amp

-potentially still use Audyssey/room correction?

Is this essentially impossible? Is most logical way to add a 2.1 system to just get a power amp instead of an integrated amp? (For clarification, having two totally separate systems is not an option for me right now)"

I'm torn between going for a ""higher"" end set of active speakers, probably either the Edifier  R2850DB or the R2750DB versus going for a relatively budget passive set up. I was looking into the Yamaha A-S201 along with the Sony SS-CS5 accompanied by a bluetooth DAC. Bluetooth is non-debatable in the budget but I'd also like to have optical in if possible.  


The active option is far cheaper, like 25-30% cheaper and includes everything in terms of inputs and it just works.  
The passive option, well it's a passive option which is presumably better? Never had any of that gear.   


PS. The upgrade is intended as a hi-fi/home cinema for a medium sized living room. A tv is going to be hooked on and often wireless music streaming. The plan is to replace my current R2000DB to move them in my office.

I've done a little digging into this and to be frank it has left looking up various speakers and staring at their frequency response graphs without any clear conclusion of what I should actually buy.

I live in an apartment, and I will place these speakers in the main room. The main room is sizeable and has very high ceilings (8m by 4m and 3m high ceilings?). I don't have a bookshelf to put the speakers on so this leads me to think buying speakers with a stand may be better, but I am unsure.

audiophile,"I'm looking for a set of desktop speakers that look nice, and aren't very big. Jamo S803 looks too big, for example, but RB42s are perfect. I need a decent low-end without a sub, but a sub out for the next upgrade is required. I would like to be at no more than $350. If something was $335 and sounded slightly worse than something $350, I would go with the cheaper option.

This is what I'm currently looking at:

RB42 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JC416LG/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=AFKH6OU9WWNFS&amp;psc=1

SMSL SA300 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081DJD1G4/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3DLIZX4T1QPH&amp;psc=1

This is appealing because the RB42 has reportedly good low-end, doesn't look like shit, and is compact. If there's an alternative to either the speakers or amp please let me know.

I've been looking at powered options with a sub-out, such as YU, YU2, Fluance Ai61, Powered BS5, Audioengine A2+, and R1700BTS.

If you have any thoughts or recommendations, please let me know. I've been looking at second-hand in my area, but no luck yet."

I'm curious to hear from folks who have run either of these DACs and especially curious to hear from folks who have tried both. They seem to show up on the used market at prices between $150 - $200 pretty regularly and I'm interested in hearing how they compare and why you'd recommend one over the other. Happy to hear about other DACs in this price range too, but mostly interested in these too. 

Some of this is probably a discussion of the Sabre (Peachtree) vs BurrBrown (Cambridge Audio) chipset, but also the overall implementation and functionality is of interest to me. 

I'm interested in hearing how they sound to you in your system, but to the extent my system matters, the DAC would take inputs from a CD player, music files over USB from a computer, and music streamed from a BlueSound Node 2i, and would play into a NAD C 320BEE amp and PSB Image 5T speakers."

I recently changed my Zensor 7s to Oberon 7s. I have a Denon PMA720ae amp (85W) and I‚Äôm considering retiring this amp to something more powerful. I‚Äôm doing it in the hope of having even more clarity/separation on low volume and a tighter bass. 

Can anyone recommend me a sort of budget amp that would go well with the Oberon 7s and eventually even with Focal Aria 926? That would be my end game in terms of speakers. 

I am consiering a Cambridge Audio AXR 100 but I heard that the bass might be a bit slughish on those (never heard one in person).

audiophile,"So I don't really even consider myself an ""audiophile""; I'm still gonna listen to MP3's through convenient Bluetooth headphones or crappy Amazon Basics speakers at work for most of the time, and it's gonna be totally serviceable. And when I do indulge in higher quality music, I'm totally fine with 16 Bit 44.1khz FLACS with my 32 ohm $180 headphones plugged straight into my PC, no external DAC or amp necessary.

The thing is, even by making such a basic switch and being as entry level of an audiophile as I can be, I'm already THOROUGHLY enjoying the experience. Going back and listening to songs I thought I knew front and back and hearing instruments I didn't know were there, or loads of other details that just got lost in compression, it's such a wild experience. And I'm very glad that I've made the choice to indulge.

audiophile,"Very short story time --- I'm not an audiophile. The extent of my knowledge is knowing the difference between a studio monitor and bookshelf speaker and difference between a receiver and an amplifier. But I do want to upgrade my sound. With that in mind, I've had trouble finding the ballpark average pricing for many speakers because i don't know where to look and stuff. 

Anyway, my dad bought a Yamaha receiver I'd say six years ago and it has essentially never been used, so I was thinking of taking it and using it for my room for tv and music. However, I don't have any bookshelf speakers that can be used with the receiver. 

So I've been looking and asking around, and I've found some decently appealing deals to my untrained eye: 
1. A pair of B&amp;W DM303s for $120

2. A pair of Pioneer SP-BS22-LR (Andrew Jones) + the Pioneer Center Channel Speaker (from the same line) for $140

3. A pair of Fosgate FA51.0 bookshelfs and potentially a subwoofer. (However i haven't gotten a response on how much he's going to be offering me, so for this I'm asking what would be considered an average price or good deal for these.)

I am looking to buy used.

Thanks for any help in advance."
audiophile,"My (probably controversial) hypothesis is that if you spend 1000 euros or dollar in a streaming setup on one piece, the relative difference it makes in overall sound quality ranks as follows:

4. Active subwoofer
5. Power-Amp
6. Streamer/DAC/Pre-Amp
8. Anything else

Any tips to do a reset or repair would be appreciated."
audiophile,"Might not be as crazy as the full blown setups on here, but it's insane for it's size and beats out any other portable Bluetooth speaker. Quality is spot on, adjusting the EQ via the app is easy, and the only downside is that at higher volumes the bass is a little weak but that's not to say it's bad at all.


Get two of them and the sub for a 2.1 setup and a 3d printed carrying thingy for them and it turns them into a boombox, but unlike a typical boombox you can pack them into a bag for travel. If you want ""audiophile"" on the go I think these are great. 

Aesthetically I love them. That's why I went for a limited edition one. Hate the way typical consumer grade stuff are designed to look like toys, but this would fit right into a professional studio even though it's not made for that.

audiophile,"Please I could really use some help here.

I purchased a Yamaha A-S1200 in December.  Recently I noticed the amplifier itself (not the speakers) emitting quiet but not insignificant buzzing sound.  As I was investigating I found that it is significantly worse when the warm air humidifier is powered on.  With the humidifier off it's seems to vary from barely audible to not detectable after the power is cycled.  Disconnecting inputs or switching to unused inputs did not have any effect.  It is definitely emanating from the amp and not the speakers.

I assumed I had dirty power in my house so I put it on an isobar ultra power strip.  I can't say that had any effect. Turning on the humidifier still causes the amplifier to buzz  and the buzz is still there, sometimes, with the humidifier off.  I haven't been able to tie the hum to any other devices in the house.


The end effect is very faint and even with the humidifier off.   I'm not sure if it's some defect in the amp but I really don't think I'm expecting too much thinking an amp at this price point should be silent.  Of course my house could have garbage wiring and even the nicest amp may have issues, I don't know.

 I'm going to try to talk the the store tomorrow but want to go in as best informed as I can.  So if anyone has thoughts on what this issue may be, please let me know."

audiophile,"Hi everybody!

I'm trying to do something unusual. Most of you would say don't do it, but I hope this great community has a few hints for what I'm trying to do.

I'd like to have a setup with a single, simple to use, non-glitchy remote control.

I have 3.1 with pretty good floor standing speakers. 95% of the time the setup is used to watch youtube and netflix. My Samsung TV knows how to show the content and has a pretty good UI. I feed  audio from TV to receiver via HDMI. Receiver is locked to the TV input most of the time and just sends amplified signal to speakers. Entire family enjoys simple to use UI with a single remote.

The remaining 5% of the time the system might be used to stream higher quality audio from Spotify or other services. TV can play it, but sound quality is noticeably worse if fed from TV.

I have a 5 year old Denon AVR in this setup. It has some early days streaming technology including Spotify, but it's glitchy, disconnects constantly and lacks support for latest standards. Also, the receiver is not doing a good job at higher volumes and either needs to be replaced or accompanied by an amp. 

During music listening I prefer to still use the same TV remote, but if it's not possible, a mobile application would be my second choice. I'm not crazy about Harmony or other complicated solutions like Control4.

I've heard that the newer Denon/Marantz mobile application is still as bad as the old one. I expect those eARC menus to be equally bad in new receiver models, so accessing them using TV remote is probably a bad option too. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

So currently I see the following options:

* Find a more powerful receiver that streams properly and has a decent mobile application or eARC menus. I was told that mobile apps from all receiver manufacturers are equally bad. Since all receivers are very similar, I would pick one with better mobile app. I've seen one opinion about Yamaha that it has a better application and wireless speaker support, which might be useful. If you have opinions here, I'd be grateful to learn.
* Get a newer receiver to deal with higher volumes and a streamer like WiiM, which is supposedly better than built-in hardware and UI. I would still have to figure out a way to switch between inputs without AVR remote.
* Keep the receiver, get 3+ channel amp and a streamer like WiiM. Same problem with switching inputs.
* Keep the receiver, get 3+ channel amp and a smart box with streaming capabilities like Apple TV or NVidia Shield. Same input switching problem, but a supposedly more capable box than WiiM even though I only need streaming and don't need Apple TV UI or apps.
* Completely redo the setup and use some kind of smart remote like Harmony. Never been a fan of complex solutions, but if it's the last resort, I would love to understand the implications and most importantly what exactly I need to buy.

What would you guys do in my case? Which options are better? Do you see any other options?"

Still others say that 128 is transparent (I don‚Äôt think it quite is) while others swear by 320.

Which speakers do you consider great ? We are around 5k budget more or less. Why are vintage speakers so adored ? What do they have more than modern speakers ? Like a warmer sound ?

I am in the process of setting up my very first Hi-Fi system and have decided to go with the Marantz Cinema 40 (or 50) and the KEF R series speakers (R5, R7, or R11, not sure yet)  and the KEF center speaker R2C.

 I've been collecting vinyl since I was a teenager and now I'm in my mid 30's and thinking it's time to upgrade my system. Unfortunately I am pretty ignorant when it comes to turntable set up, pre amp equalizers its just too much. I'm wanting to myself an early birthday gift and upgrade my turn table from an audio tech so possibly a Uturn custom orbit. 

 I currently have a budget of around $2000.00 USD for a whole set up ( turn table, receiver, speakers etc ) New or vintage I don't mind as I am just trying to get the best sound quality for my bus.

Thanks in advance,"
audiophile,"I‚Äôm looking for some advice on a decent pair of over ears. I‚Äôd like to keep it under $1000. I currently have a pair of hd599 and Ie300‚Äôs which I both really like. I have a topping dx3pro+ DAC/AMP combo, that I really enjoy and don‚Äôt plan on upgrading, so I‚Äôm keeping a relatively low impedance in mind. So far I‚Äôve narrowed it down to focal clear‚Äôs or maybe hd660s. I listen to mainly rock, and would also use for gaming/ entertainment. Any advice is appreciated!"
audiophile,I'm fixing up my garage on a house I bought 2 years ago. The garage is 26x28 with 10 ft ceilings and the garage is bare studs at the moment. I already have a onkyo TX-NR676 2 klipsch 820f towers and a rs12sw klipsch subwoofer. I plan on wiring four surround sound speakers in each corner near the ceiling. Was thinking of mounting some klipsch book shelf speakers down at an angle. I could use some advice on what other speakers I could use if there is something better out the there. My budget is $1000 for the four surround speakers. I also plan to add or replace my sub cause I don't think it will be enough for the size of my garage. Also what sub would give me best bang for buck under $500. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks

audiophile,"Hey guys. :)

I felt like sharing my impressions of the Pyle PDA6BU.6 receiver, because I found this to be a very interesting device. Also, looking online elsewhere there don't appear to be any reviews whatsoever on any tech sites, other than customer reviews on Amazon. 

**Initial Online Glances**

The reason why I bought this receiver was because I really liked its compact look and design. I planned on having it tucked in a corner of my basement area (as seen in the pictures), so I wanted something I could easily fit on a corner shelf. I also like the features it comes with, and the receiver has a line-out for recording to a tape deck. I also knew I was only going to use this for stereo audio, so it isn't hooked up to a TV or anything. I have an 8-track deck that I plan on using with it, the tape deck just got professionally repaired and is shipping back to me as we speak. So I felt like this receiver suited my needs for what I was going to use it for.

**Real-world Impressions/Overview**

Once I got the receiver around Christmas of 2022, I actually had an opportunity to play-test it with my 8-track deck a bit. Sure enough, hooking the deck up to the receiver was super straightforward. One thing I don't really like is when the speaker connections are those black/red wire screw things. There's probably a decent enough reason for it, but it's just more tedious to hook up than just having RCA cables. Anyway, once I got everything hooked up I was able to power it on and try it out.

It's a bit busy on the front of the receiver, with various knobs for treble, bass, balance, volume, etc. There are also some small silver buttons, all in a row, for play/pause/next track/previous track, mode, etc. The available inputs you get are CD, DVD, AUX and MP3/BT. The receiver also comes with a handy little remote, which I'll get into later.

Upon turning on the Pyle PDA6BU.6, I was greeted with an extremely blinding blue light emitting from the power LED and front LCD display, which curiously reads ""NO DISK"". Jeez, LOL. Seriously, this thing is BRIGHT when you turn it on. I'm pretty sure you can illuminate a good-size room with it.

Anyway, the ""NO DISK"" message always shows up regardless of which input you have it on. Strange, but okay. When I set the input knob to AUX and tried my 8-track deck with it, it outputted the tape audio perfectly fine. The 8-track deck had its own issues, which is why I sent it out for repairs (as mentioned above), but that's besides the point. The receiver was doing its job.

After I sent my tape deck out for repairs, there was about a 2-3 week window where I really didn't have a chance to play with the receiver very much, so it remained off for a while. This past weekend I decided to play with it a bit and see what $60 on Amazon gave me. I turned it on with the now-familiar ""NO DISK"" message on the screen and proceeded to mess with it.

**FM Radio**

I discovered from watching the two or three other YouTube videos on this receiver that you can switch ""modes"" by pressing the MODE button. So I decided to try out the FM radio features. Once I got to it, I had to go through a scanning process on the front display. That took about a minute or two. Once the scan was done, I noticed that the receiver actually assigned ""channels"" to every station that could be picked up. So when you're tuning the radio, you're actually just flipping through the channels of stations that the receiver could pick up. It's pretty efficient actually, and I never saw a radio that worked like that.

While I was messing with the radio, I noticed something right off the bat-- no volume. I turned up the volume knob on the receiver itself, but this didn't work. I also tried the volume buttons on the remote, but that didn't work either. After toying with it for a couple minutes, I had to leave because we were running errands, but during the day I was worried I had gotten a defective unit.

When I got back home and finally had another chance to play with the Pyle receiver, I was still perplexed. The radio stations/functions were displaying on the front LCD, but there was no sound no matter what I did. After another minute of toying with the receiver, it had occurred to me that it was still on the AUX input from when I was initially testing it with my 8-track deck a few weeks prior. So, I flipped the input selector over to ""MP3/BT""-- **eurika!** The sound was working! 

**Internal DAC**

Once I got sound working for the radio, I realized one of this receiver's main design quirks-- the internal DAC (Digital-Analogue Converter) is completely independent from the rest of the receiver, and it's tied to the ""MP3/BT"" input. When you have the receiver flipped to the AUX/DVD/CD inputs, the internal DAC never notices that you've done so, and the screen just remains on whatever ""mode"" the DAC was set to. Usually when you're working with a receiver, selecting different inputs will cause the screen to show something different and related to that input. Here, that isn't the case. It seems like the LCD screen, the silver buttons that are grouped together, and the *remote* are all tied to the Internal DAC, which is tied specifically to the receiver's MP3/BT input. As far as the internal DAC goes, it literally has no idea that it's actually inside a receiver unit. LOL.

**Remote Control**

That brings me to my next item of my review-- the remote control. On Amazon I had already seen reviews stating that the remote was useless. So I was curious what people meant by that.

Well as it turns out, the remote can only control the internal DAC portion of the receiver-- nothing else. This actually doesn't bother me too much, because the way I'll be using the receiver and where I'll have it doesn't necessarily require a remote. And if I use the Bluetooth mode, I'll just be controlling it remotely from my phone anyway. But very bizarre, nonetheless.

Another interesting thing about the remote is the volume control and EQ settings. When you use the remote to adjust the volume, it adjusts the volume and shows it on the screen. But what you may not realize right off the bat is, you're really adjusting the volume on the internal DAC, not the actual receiver. That's right-- you have two different volume controls. LOL. And FYI, the volume knob on the receiver takes precedence over the internal DAC's volume. This also means that the EQ feature only works on the MP3/BT input, and none of the other inputs. 

**Bluetooth**

Once I figured out the madness above, I tried out the Bluetooth feature of the receiver since I had no SD card or USB flash drive handy (it supports those two formats as well by the way, and yes-- they are part of the internal DAC on the ""MP3/BT"" input). On other devices, the receiver will show up as ""PYLE USA"". From what I noticed, the Bluetooth range is actually quite good for a $60 receiver. I was able to go about 30 feet before the signal started breaking up a little. I tried it with my Galaxy Z Flip 3 phone, and my Amazon Echo Show 8-- both devices paired easily. I also got to really try out the receiver for sound quality, and I was pretty pleased with the results. I found myself jamming out to some Boston tracks.

One thing I found funny is that when you disconnect from Bluetooth via your phone (or other device), the receiver actually makes the Windows 3.1 startup chime. LOL!

**Conclusion**

Overall, I can completely see why other people would have problems with the Pyle PDA6BU.6. The remote **is** in fact pretty useless, only being able to control the functions on the MP3/BT input. The fact that the internal DAC works in a very separate fashion from the rest of the receiver will also throw people off. It seems like Pyle combined an amplifier, an input selector, and an internal DAC into a compact box and called it a day. This is a very strange device. 

Having said that, I'd say for me personally this was a very good purchase from Amazon. Being that this receiver will reside in a finished/open basement area, I feel like it's the perfect fit for my use-case scenario. It also sounds pretty good and pumps out a nice amount of volume. I think this receiver works well for a basement/garage/workshop environment, where you ONLY want a music system, but not necessarily a fully-fledged home theater receiver. Technically speaking this receiver could certainly plug into a TV and output its audio, but that's not the ideal situation for it. 

Hope this helps out other people looking to buy this unit."

audiophile,"I recently moved my home theater setup and, despite (AFAIK) everything being identical down to the cables, now apps like Disney+ and HBO do not output sound properly when the PS5 is set to output PCM (other apps like Netflix or games seem to behave properly). Specifically, ONLY the left and right channels output audio (so nothing, such as dialogue, comes from the center channel for example). The receiver shows the incoming signal from the PS5 as 7 channel PCM so for whatever reason it seems like the PS5 is outputting a 7 channel signal with ONLY data in the left and right. Setting the PS5 output to Dolby results in a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù 5 channel dolby output from the PS5 but on some content (like Mandalorian season 2) simply pausing the episode seemingly disrupts the ‚Äúhandshake‚Äù process or something and the episode plays without audio. Other content like bad batch season 1 on Disney and The Last of Us on HBO (perhaps due to being lower bandwidth?) seems to behave more normally on Dolby, but still has the exact ‚Äúonly left and right‚Äù issue on PCM.

Prior to the move I was able to always leave it set to PCM and my AV receiver always properly output audio on all 7 channels regardless of content (game, streaming app, etc). Specifically, dialogue would come out of the center channel, surrounds were used properly, and I didn‚Äôt have to do anything special when switching between sources.

Would really appreciate any help / insight here. It‚Äôs driving me crazy that this used to work perfectly, and the fact that content like Mandalorian S2 doesn‚Äôt properly work with either Dolby or PCM leads me to believe there‚Äôs something legitimately wrong with my setup.

audiophile,"Thought I'd share my initial findings. I know I'm a little late to the party as I've already seen some posts about this but still thought I'd share.

I'm using mine in my office, replacing an old laptop that I was using previously for streaming. I was having issues with spotify casting to that laptop and was hoping this might solve the problem in addition to having a laptop running 24/7 just for streaming.

Anyway, got the device yesterday and hooked it up. Initially, the SPDIF connection wasn't coming on, but after setting it as the default line-out on the app and rebooting the device everything worked perfectly. Currently running it into a Topping D50s &gt; old NAD receiver &gt; KEF speakers.

Other than setup, I haven't used the app much. Spotify found the device right away and has shown no issues I was experiencing with the laptop. Tracks are playing at 320kbps 16/44.1 according to the app.

It took me a few minutes to get Chromecast going, but once set up, I was able to find the device in Roon and set everything up accordingly. For now, I'm able to send 24/96 flac over Chromecast without issue. Roon shows everything working properly in the signal path and the D50s displays 96khz on the screen. Flacs larger than 24/96 (24/192 tested) get downsampled to 24/96. I have also tried Tidal MQA through Roon. I have MQA decoding set in the WiiM app, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything. All MQA files (24/96, 24/192, etc) I've tested through Roon/Tidal appear to only play at 24/48 - no idea if that will improve once the WiiM gets Roon Ready status, considering Roon can then do the decoding. Still, not a big loss to me since I'm rarely actively listening in my office and it's more just background music while I work.

Overall, I'm pleased with the device, especially for the price. I had been looking for a replacement for that laptop for quite some time but couldn't find anything at a reasonable price. WiiM Mini looked nice but didn't tick enough boxes. The Pro seems to do the job tho."
audiophile,"I've owned my io 6 for about two years now and I have had this weird problem since the start. I always thought that it stemmed from my phone but I just got a new phone ant the problem continues to irk me.

Basically every time I listen to audio in one ap, such as Spotify, and then open another app that also has audio, such as a Snapchat video, the sound completely cuts out and is replaced with a high pitched sound. To get rid of the sound i have to switch from Bluetooth to speaker and back again.

The same thing happens in situations like switching videos on YouTube shorts, locking at two consecutive videos on Snapchat or goes from a regular YouTube video to a YouTube short without pausing the original video and waiting for a couple of seconds.

If anyone has any ideas for how to fix this issue it would be greatly appreciated since I am really fed up with it now. And I honestly don't know how I have endured this for two years haha!"
audiophile,"I have searched for, but could not find a DAC with 2 USB inputs that mix into 1 output. Does that exist?I'm not looking for alternative sollutions. I can explain why.

I have 2 PCs that both feed into 1 aplifier. Currently using an analog audio mixer. But the built in DACs of my PCs aren't great and I think Anyone know if such a thing exist?the chaining of analog devices is causing hissing. So I want to eliminate as much of the analog stuff as possible.

I know there are DACs that can mix multiple inputs, but all the ones I could find use toslink or analog audio input. I want to avoid toslink. I also want to avoid inputting analog audio into the DAC.

So the ideal sollution for me would be a DAC with 2 USB inputs that can be mixed into 1 analog output with 2 volume knobs/sliders. Anyone know if such a thing exist?"

So my question is in general, do they work at canceling noise from outside? And if so is it better than ANC? 

And for the price (40‚Ç¨ I'm looking at) do they sound good enough to support the gimmick/feature of their noise canceling? Or should anyone just try to save some more money and buy some slightly more expensive earbuds with ANC like the Sennheiser CX pro at 80‚Ç¨ or something like that?

audiophile,"Like the title says i've been obsessed with metal (and especially black metal) for half my life and probably listened to more music then most people would do in 3 lifetimes. However as a short disclaimer its only in the recent year or 2 that i've been getting really into the technical side of music. Things like audio compression, different codecs, mixing, rhythms, chord progressions etc. But hey, i think that's totally fine. I am not here to debate or ""knowledge bomb"" anyone just talk about the things which i actually do have a very deep knowledge about and find interesting. And i mean i dont consider my opinion as levitating above everyone else's. If someone brings good arguments and explains why i am wrong, i am totally fine with learning/ changing my opinion on something.

The first thing i wanna talk about is audio compression, and some many audio nerds always say the same thing: Why does it matter? Isn't it all created with instruments distorted into oblivion with mixing made to sound bad intentionally anyways? 

Well kinda yeah it is. But that is also why additional compression ontop of that will just totally destroy any Black Metal track which already has those qualities, in the same way that recompressing an already compressed song further can turn good music into just pure abomination. So in total opposition of what most people think having good audio quality for black metal is actually incredibly important to enjoy it fully and in no other genre do you notice so clearly the difference between lossless and lossy formats. (There are also many other factors which contribute to this)

Man especially those oldschool burzum/mayhem albums 90% of people listened to on youtube as their introduction to black metal 6-9 years ago lol. Ontop of being 320 kbps mp3 and then recompressed again for youtube into 128 kbps they are some of the very, very few albums that were actually intentionally made with bad quality. If you where to listen to this and compare it to a lossless version of Dissection - Somberlain (released before any of Burzums popular albums) or Bathory - Blood fire Death (Released 6 years before Somberlain) it wouldnt even sound like the same genre of music anymore. Or if u wanna get picky even comparing a lossless version of early Darkthrone, which was made and recorded in the same style as those earlier mentioned.

Anyways i could talk about this stuff forever but this was supposed to be more of a discussion thing and not just a monologue. So i'll mention some more topics i can expand upon within this genre if people find it interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

* The ""science"" behind why even masterfully mixed, recorded and produced Black metal sounds like ""just noise"" to first time listeners.
* Black Metal in 2023 vs 1990
* How to make amazing sounding Metal from ""bad quality""

I guess i can just throw in some unrelated audio questions i had aswell if someone is in more of a trivia mood lol.

* I know basically nothing about soundcards for Pcs and i'm planning on learning some more about them before i buy one. What are the differences/advantages vs just using the default one built into your BIOS, and if i'm gonna do some casual reading/learning where should i start?
* Is there anyway to determine the bitrate of a soundfile you just record from audio playing on your desktop pc. As example: I start up Audacity and record some audio from youtube which i know is between 128-256 kbps but when i save it as .flac it usually says its somewhere between 800-900 bitrate.
* Wait, is bitrate and kbps even the same thing lol? I feel like i've seen people use both terms to describe the same thing so many times but maybe i'm wrong lol."

audiophile,"I have two 4ohm speakers (ts-a6880F) I want to make a ""soundbar"" or separated by a foot or two. My question is what is the best option amp (mono or 2ch) for this if I want to replicate what the TV sound has but better ?

Detailed question/concern:

Will the 2 channel (left and right) speakers create a distortion by not having a true center speaker? I don't want to get a headache listening to thiseach other..? In theory. The left and right speaker should be placed apart in line of TV speakers? Maybe over analyzing the waves of sound and where person sits (knowing this a bit).

Will the mono amp with the two speakers act as the center speaker without issues? Naturally,  I would place the two speakers next to eachother..?"

audiophile,"I want to treat my music listening room.  I‚Äôve used HiFi  Audio  Design (http://www.mh-audio.nl/Acoustics/diffusor.asp#calcul) to get started figuring a few things out.

I want to DIY some quadratic residue diffusers and frames to hang cotton acoustic batts wrapped in fabric.  I‚Äôm an experienced woodworker with access to commercial equipment and CNC machines and tons of experience making stuff just like this, it seems easy enough for me to accomplish.  Also, the aesthetics of this room are of little importance.  That said, I don‚Äôt want tall heavy skyline diffusers making this room feel any smaller than it is.  I‚Äôm looking for a great improvement, not 100% perfection.  I also play some guitar and bass in here.  I‚Äôm not concerned about what happens to the audio in here when I do that, I‚Äôm not recording, just wailin‚Äô n‚Äô jammin‚Äô!  I also sometimes dance in here with my 2yo daughter, she loves music.

My room is an 11.5 foot by 12.5 foot room.

The Schroeder frequency fs = 165 Hz
Monopole reverb distance Rm = 0.65 m -or- 2.13 ft
Avg wall absorption a = 34%

I want to build a 60 cm wide diffuser with a theoretical depth of 21 cm.  60 cm because that‚Äôs about how wide my closet doors are.

http://www.mh-audio.nl/Acoustics/diffusor.asp#calcul

My f-low will be 581 Hz and f-high will be 3846 Hz.  Is this appropriate?  The 581 Hz will have a full 3 feet to develop before it hits the listening position.  This diffuser will go directly behind the listening position hanging on a closet wall, about 2 feet wide and 4 feet tall.

Pic of the room:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X934iAa1LryqZ9cgMpezwCLqHd-Bl9DE/view?usp=drivesdk

Question 1 (Q1) - Should I hang a diffuser on both closet doors?  I would completely retrofit the diffuser into the back sliding closet door, again, easy enough for me to do. Or is the one diffuser enough?

Question 2.1 and 2.2 - Should I put diffusers or absorbers behind these speakers?  I feel like the diffusers would be just too close to the speakers, and I couldn‚Äôt find much info on distance behind speakers to put diffusers.  I‚Äôm thinking absorbers, plus a 6 pack of 2‚Äô x 4‚Äô x 2‚Äù cotton batts leaves me two on each wall and one behind each speaker.  This being such a small room, I currently have the speakers near the wall, just because that‚Äôs where I put them.  They are bookshelf B&amp;W‚Äôs rear ported.

Questions 3 - Do I just stuff a bass trap cube up in the corner above the window?  Seems silly in pics.  But is it really that simple?  I don‚Äôt see much math or elaboration on this anywhere, which has me overthinking it compared to diffusion and absorption talk in general."
audiophile,"This might be a very beginner question, but I'm wondering why gaming headsets' microphones sort of distort the quality?

For example, in the video below, whenever he's on the gaming headset he gets distorted audio, otherwise it's super clear.
https://youtu.be/PThAJ49BMmU

In my use case, if I use my Bluetooth Plantronics headset I actually get worse quality than if I just use my laptop's built in mic. I read something somewhere that having your speaker and mic come through on the same device causes issues, but I tried to test that theory out and haven't made progress.

Any ideas? Any good resources I can read through? At the end of the day, I'm in need of a good gaming headset, that I was also hoping would double as a step up from my laptop's built in mic (for video voiceovers)."

First time poster. My setup:

audiophile," I am contemplating a major project, but I am looking for advice before I begin.  Several years ago, I ripped my extensive CD collection (pop, rock, classical) to FLAC files.  When I purchase downloads, I always purchase FLAC format, usually 44.1/16, but some are 24 bit. I listen exclusively via headphones, a FiiO M11s serves as the digital transport, and a FiiO K9Pro (AKM) is the DAC/Amp. Both support DSD up to 256. 

 I would very much appreciate answers to the following questions:   
  1. Does the difference between DSD and FLAC represent a real improvement in sound quality?

 2. Does converting (up-sampling?) a file from FLAC to DSD involve a  reduction the of quality of the file?  (Note: this would be my greatly preferred way, as it would preserve all of the corrections/enhancements I have made to the metadata tags in the ripped FLAC files over the last couple of years.) 

3. Considering only sound quality, would I be better served by re-ripping the CDs directly to DSD? 

4. How much larger are DSD files? (I know it would be an estimate but if a FLAC file is 100 MB, how large would a DSD file of the same CD track likely be?) 

5. What would a good ripper/conversion tool be? 

6. Finally, in your opinions, is the juice worth the squeeze?  I do have the time, but I dislike wasted effort if there will not be a perceptible sonic improvement.

audiophile,"I recently picked up two ADS L400 speakers (from my town dump, believe it or not). On one speaker, I can notice clear chopping on the tweeter. Other than that, they sound great, though. My guess is that the crossover filter capacitor has dried up. I was going to honestly just make myself a new crossover filter.

However, I'm having a bit of trouble just opening the case to get a look at the PCB. I can take off the input connector panel and feel the PCB on the back, but I can't seem to get any of the front speakers out. I unscrewed the four screws around both the sub and tweeter, but the panels don't want to budge. I've tried prying the tweeter and sub panels up with a screwdriver, but I only succeeded in scratching the front panel. Does anybody know how to get the thing open without damaging it?

Second, when I removed the connector panel, I noticed the speaker was filled with yellow (probably fiberglass) insulation.

Even if this is fiberglass (and not something like asbestos), my understanding is that the dust from this stuff can be carcinogenic. I was wearing a KN95 at the time and the ventilation was good, so I'm not super worried right now, but if I want to replace the crossover, I'm going to need to take this stuff out. Does anybody know what this stuff is/if there are any safety issues with it?"

When I was older, I picked up a pair of Sony headphones that were the same. I loved how long the cord was because it was easy to move around and sit near the receiver.

Now it seems like everything I look at is either wireless or it has a small skinny cord that‚Äôs only a few feet long.  I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm typing in the wrong information in the search bar. Any recommendations for a new or vintage set of headphones that would fit the bill? Decent quality audio, 8-10 foot (uncoiled) cord, over the ear with a quarter inch headphone jack."

audiophile,"I have never really engaged with the audiophile world before - I could hear the difference between a crap hifi and one I liked listening to, but never spent a lot of money on equipment (I found I could be perfectly happy listening to music without spending a lot). I have been using an old Leak Stereo 70, a Pioneer PL-120 (not as old, but probably close!) and a pair of Omar bookshelf-sized speakers that I have had since I was a teenager for close to 20 years now (incidentally, I have NEVER been able to find any information about these speakers online. All I know is that they sound nice, and were made in the UK). Well, the Leak was on it's last legs (some caps were replaced about five years ago, but more recently there were some weird noises that sounded like failing caps, and one of the channels was periodically cutting out. It didn't seem like it was worth spending the money to have more components replaced) so I started looking for something new. 

WELL, my old man had just got a new turntable, so I got some old equipment from him - a Rega Brio 3, Rega P6 with a moving coil cartridge and a Rega Fono MC phono stage. I set it all up, mostly just excited to listen to music through both channels without having to knock on my amp every now and again to get it sounding right. What I did NOT expect was everything to sound so much more FUN and exciting! I have honestly never enjoyed playing records so much. I feel like I should have bought fewer records and saved the money to upgrade this system years ago!

That's all!"
audiophile,"Hey Reddit,

I‚Äôve had a Clear Audio Concept with the satisfy tonearm upgrade for about the past year and a half. My stylus is worn out, so I‚Äôm at a decision point if I should just replace the cart or get a new table and wanted to see what other people‚Äôs experiences are with the Concept.

I‚Äôve read nothing but rave reviews about this table online. I don‚Äôt know if my experience is an outlier, but the turntable has been absolute garbage for me from day one. My main gripes are a loud motor noise when the table is powered on with a quiet (but persistent) light hiss and the cheap quality of the tonearm lift and the leveling feet, which are two things that completely blindsided me at the price point of the Concept.

I had upgraded from a used Technics SL-D20 direct drive. I thought the huge price disparity, moving from a direct drive to belt drive, the ability to get away from P-Mount carts, and not having something like auto return would lead to overall better sound quality, but I guess not.

Any thoughts from Concept owners? I‚Äôm really at a loss since I‚Äôve seen nothing but positive reviews online, but I‚Äôm really not impressed with the table. I‚Äôm considering trying to cut my losses and sell the table, but I don‚Äôt have the original box and would feel guilty pawning this junk onto someone else. Would reaching out to Clearaudio be helpful?

Also posted this to r/turntables for thoughts, but wanted to also ask here since I know this table is a popular recommendation on this sub."

audiophile,"I‚Äôm very much still learning about the advantages of a stereo speaker setup and how to get the best performance out of it compared to a portable Bluetooth speaker (which is what I‚Äôm currently used to listening to music with). My goal is to understand what type of speaker will best suit my needs.

I‚Äôm in the market for a new speaker since my old one (UE Boom, first gen) has finally kicked the can. But I realized that I don‚Äôt ever take my speaker outside my home anymore; I just use headphones everywhere else. So I thought ‚Äúfor the same money I would spend on a new portable Bluetooth speaker, can I instead sacrifice portability and get better audio quality with a speaker system that I would only use at home?‚Äù And my understanding of stereo speaker setups is that the answer to my question is a resounding YES!

Here‚Äôs my concern. I understand that stereo music listening is best when you can create an equilateral triangle between your two speakers, and you sit at the third point of the triangle when listening to music. That sounds great when I‚Äôm, say, sitting on my couch listening to music. But, a lot of the time when I listen to music at home, I‚Äôm not sitting in one spot. I‚Äôm cooking in the kitchen (which is an open floor plan with the living room), I‚Äôm walking around cleaning, doing laundry, etc. So my question is, would I still be getting the advantages of a stereo speaker setup vs a portable Bluetooth speaker if I‚Äôm constantly in different spots in my open living room/kitchen when using the speakers? Or will the stereo speaker setup sound more or less comparable to a portable Bluetooth speaker when outside of the ideal listening spot? (Assume the two options would be on the same budget)"
audiophile,"I have two speakers roughly equidistant from my oldish and/but trustworthy Harman Kardon TD690. Due to a bit of cable damage that ocurred, I am looking to upgrade the existing cables, as one is now causing the occasional static. These were decent, but definitely nothing special. Am looking to up the quality a bit.

I therefore ask for the expertise of you revered redditors on this matter. My banana pins can take max 4mm¬≤, which I would like to reuse.

The question: would 4x2mm¬≤ bi-wired (possibly Canare 4S11) be better than 2x4mm¬≤ (possibly Mogami W3103)? Or would the difference be negligible even at those lengths?

To clarify for the non-metrics: 15m = 49.2 feet, 2mm¬≤ = roughly AWG14, 4mm¬≤ = roughly AWG11.

audiophile,"Hello

I need some help on outputting 24 bit and 192 khz on a PC.

My PC is connected to an onkyo RZ50 through hdmi 2.1. DAC in the RZ50 can handle 24 bit, 192 khz. Sound source playback is the new apple music on windows 11. Audio quality on apple music set to 24 bit, 192khz through settings, and making sure the lossless logo is set as a song is playing.

Windows sound format output setting: 24 bit, 192000 hz, studio quality. 

When I click the info button twice on the rz50 remote, it says PCM 2.0, and FS: 192 khz.

Am I doing it correct? Did I miss anything?

Also, why does the sound format: Dolby atmos for home theather not at 192khz?

I need it on for when gaming, and it is really annoying to switch between the two formats."
audiophile,"Folks: I am very new and still learning a lot. I am running Shairplay-sync on a Pi4 through a hifi DAC HAT into a Pioneer speaker, and it works great. I‚Äôm shopping for my first AVR, and it‚Äôs tempting to pick up an older one for a song on the secondhand market, even though it doesn‚Äôt have native Airplay 2 support, which is really important to me. My question is this: Will running my music through the RPi system negate the benefits of having good speakers? I‚Äôd love to save a few hundred bucks and put that towards nicer speakers. Thanks a million, with all respect and humility."
audiophile,"I was looking at upgrading my turntable and sound system. I was looking at my receiver (Pioneer VSX-1122) and it has a ""pure"" ""stream direct"" mode. According to the manual it doesn't process the input signal and just outputs it so it keeps the analog signal. As long as the receiver can power the speakers would there be a benefit to upgrade the receiver? My basic knowledge makes me think the receiver isn't doing anything besides sending the signal out and handling the volume. It seems like the preamp would be more important."
audiophile,"Hi

I tested some headphones today. I‚Äôm not really an audiophile, I just own a HD599 and a Grado. I thought that more expensive headphones would sound incredible. But I tested a Focal Clear MG (not sure of the name) , an AKG, and few Hifiman. And I told myself that there‚Äôs a huge gap between cheap headphones and hifi headphones, but there‚Äôs a lesser gap between 200$ headphones and 500/600$ ones. I was strongly disappointed as I was hoping for some kind of exceptional experience, like some massive soundstage and incredible sound. I just told myself ‚Äúyeah there‚Äôs more mids and a different sound signature but not worth getting another pair‚Äù

However, planars sound really great. 

Please don‚Äôt be rude I‚Äôm just sharing my opinion"
audiophile,"1. Anyone using dual DACs for a 2x4 output from an all digital miniDSP Flex to a 2.2 system?

2. Would the high frequency output and low frequency output need equivalent DAC quality? eg Schiit Bifrost for speakers, Modi Multibit for subs?

3. Lots of DACs have input selector and pre-amp volume controls. I plan to do this from the Flex. Any DAC recommendations that don‚Äôt include these features? Balanced output preferred. 

4. Is the DAC in the Flex with analog output sufficient that you wouldn‚Äôt even consider the above?"
audiophile,"My dad gave me these B&amp;W speakers. I hooked them up today. Sounded good at first. Then the volume dropped and the bass cut out of the mix. Weird. Kept using them. Bass and volume cut back in... this time sounded like they were about to distort. I am guessing there is something wrong with the speakers, but for what its worth the receiver creates a bunch of static noise and this is something Ive tested out on other speakers. 

  
Is my gut instinct wrong?"
audiophile,"Hi, good people of Reddit,   
I was wondering what does give a hi-fi system a distinctive sound compared to a monitor speaker. Is it the box shape/size/material, the difference in speaker cones themselves (compared to neutral flat monitors I presume), the membrane, the cabling or/and something else?  
Also, why do the majority of hi-fi systems have regular wires as connectors while monitors have usually TRS, XLR or RCA connections? (I know about the active/passive difference, but I don't see how would that make any difference in connectors themselves). It seems to me a bit too complicated. :D  


Thanks in advance!"

audiophile,I've got a PANASONIC SA-HT730 and it's got a total RMS Dolby digital mode power of 800w which looks to be considered a high-powered system.

I'm trying to figure out if I should use speaker cables that are AWG18 or 16.  Would anyone be able to lend me their insight?
audiophile,"I am struggling to understand why someone would spend more on a streaming device like the NAIM NDX for 7000 euros. For example, if one streams from Spotify from your phone/smart TV, isn't the digital signal that is fed into your integrated amp the same?

I use a Rotel 1570 connected to my Samsung smart TV via TosLink and have always found the audio to be a bit flat when streaming spotify. Can this be improved with a better streaming device? Am I not still just feeding the same digital signal into the Rotel's DAC?"
audiophile," 

I've been using my monitors and sub through a Scarlett 2i2 with my computer, but I'm interested in hooking the speakers and sub to my TV for audio.

I've done a bit of research, but am still a little but confused about the easiest way to make this happen.

If I were to connect the monitors into my sub, the same way I've been doing for my PC, and then have two TRS output lines coming out, converted to RCA through an adapter like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Hosa-GPR-104-Female-Male-Adaptor/dp/B000068O3V/ref=sr_1_11?crid=SQIZ5320LNI1&amp;keywords=trs+female+to+rca+male+adapter&amp;qid=1673728386&amp;sprefix=trs+female+to+rca+male+adatpe%2Caps%2C69&amp;sr=8-11), then have those RCA male lines go into an audio converter like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KNNSKV0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_PX2QJKE97K28NBGD6MHM?pldnSite=1), then finally an optical line running into the back of the TV, would that make the whole system work properly?

The speakers I have are the [JBL 308](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Professional-Next-Generation-Powered-308PMKII/dp/B077NHM2K6/ref=sr_1_2?crid=N0K8V052ZBJJ&amp;keywords=jbl+308&amp;qid=1673728816&amp;s=musical-instruments&amp;sprefix=jbl+308%2Cmi%2C77&amp;sr=1-2&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.18630bbb-fcbb-42f8-9767-857e17e03685)

audiophile,"Hey everyone,

I'm in the process of building a hifi amplifier for music (see some of my other recent posts if you're interested), and I want to hook up some type of streamer to it.  Right now I'm just using my M1 Mac Mini, which sounds really good to be honest.  But I'm struggling with a workflow to control it remotely from my Macbook Air (which is usually how I control things, from the couch).

1) Right now I use spotify, which can remotely control the Mac Mini and the audio through the amplifier

2) I want to add the ability to play Flac files, which I host on a network NAS.. I need to be able to control this from the Macbook Air as well.

Any recommendations for software that will let me do this?   Any thoughts on using the Mac Mini in general, or do people recommend using an external DAC for it?

Thanks."
audiophile,"Does this currently exist in the sub-$300 range? I'm trying to buy something like this for my grandparents' TV. They currently have a pair of speakers like this, albeit very cheap POS ones that have finally bit the dust. They always had connection issues though. Mainly though they were nice because my grandparents sit on opposite sides of the room and each one would turn on their own speaker and adjust the volume (each is going through different levels of hearing loss). It was awesome because the two of them could listen to the TV at their own volume and other people could still be in the room and have a conversation without having to yell over the TC ;)

I'm looking for a similar setup by a quality manufacturer and I'm stymied. I have already several decent-looking options for BT bookshelf speakers in my price range:

- the Edifier R1280DBs, the 
- HiVi-Swans M200MKIII+
- Audioengine A1 Home Music

 but none of these have that independent volume control feature - and Googling ""independent volume"" or ""separate volume"" is turning up nothing. Anyone have any ideas or is this just not a thing anymore? Also, they already tossed the busted speakers in the trash so I can't find out what it is they already had &gt;&lt;

Thanks for any advice :)"
audiophile,"I bought a set of Kanto yu6's during the pandemic and have them setup with a Logitech smart remote connected to my TV.

It seems like I have to put the hub about 5 inches away from the ir window on the speakers to get volume up and down to work. The speakers turn on and off when I hit ""power on TV"". Assuming it's being turned on via the ir or is it just detecting audio through the toslink cable?

audiophile,"My setup right now exists of a pair of KEF Q950 towers and an Audiolab 6000A. They are hooked up to my TV with an Apple TV 4K. So they are used for music and watching tv. (I'm not really into surround sound, so my focus is on 2 channel listening.)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know thos KEF towers could handle a more powerful amp, but I'm very happy with Audiolabs sound and design. Also the Audiolab still gives enough power to listen loud, just not reaally loud. Otherwise i would go into protect.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have 2 questions really. 

1) If I connect an active subwoofer to the pre-out of the Audiolab. Will this 'free up' some power so to speak? So, the subwoofer takes over the task to play bass and the audiolab won't struggle to play a bit louder in the mids and highs?

2) Or instead of looking into subs, should i rather save up for a more powerful amp? like the Audiolab 9000A?

Anyway this is for those specific moments 95% of the time my current setup is more than enough.

I use a UMIK-1 together with Dirac Live and during the measurement process, I give my best to maintain a microphone-position that is pointing towards the speakercenter, and is in the same time, parallel to the ground.

Till now I checked that with an external digital spirit level that I held on top of the UMIK-1 microphone, to correctly adjust the angle.

Now I had the idea to fix a spirit level bubble that is very tiny (this one: [https://i.imgur.com/Pkta1p5.png](https://i.imgur.com/Pkta1p5.png) ), on top of the UMIK-1.... I want to fix it with a transparent tape right here, where the red line is: [https://i.imgur.com/lBkdP47.png](https://i.imgur.com/lBkdP47.png)

audiophile,"Hi all I currently run a Bose T20 setup from a good 10 years ago I believe. Looking to finally upgrade to something better all around for mainly movies but also music. Some things about me.

1) I am a gamer and it's important to have a modern Receiver with 4K outputs that's also hopefully low latency.
2) I listen to a lot of concerts through blu-ray disk and vinyls so sound quality &amp; loudness matters
3) I have no neighbors nearby so I am able to crank it up loud
4) my budget is around 3000$ but I can be flexible if needed or spend less if there's some good budget stuff out there that would blow my Bose T20 away

Was thinking of making a home theater setup out of Polk R700 tower speakers but not sure if they would be good for a home theater setup or if they are more just for music. 

I don't know much about home theater audio or about what receiver to get and if I will need an amp or if I need to buy my own wire for the setup too. I am very savvy though so if I could get some direction on what to buy I am sure I can easily put it all together. Thanks for all your help in advance!!!"
audiophile,"Hey guys, kind of new to the audiophile world and the whole chain of setup.

So I use my PC as a station for audio, driving a turntable and and a usb CD player. My motherboard is a Aorus x480 gaming 5 with a ALC1220-VB Enhance 114dB backed up by supposedly high end audio capacitors WIMA FKP2.

Recently I bought the iFi Zen Dac V2 to improve my audio by using it as a headphone amp for my Sennheiser 560S as well as a preamp for my Presonus eris 3.5 active speakers. I must admit that the audio improved a lot, espacially as both the headphones and speakers were on the brighter side ans benefited a lot from the TrueBass feature on the ifi.

My question really is, will I benefit from an external let's say a sound card for both my analog and digital setup.
Is my audio affected by the onboard chip or the amp in my active speakers or is it both? Or does it bypass it?
I have more doubts that my turntable does mingle with the amp from the pc it amplifies and signal from the built in preamp, however not sure in regards to the amp in the active speakers.

Sorry if this was a lot, wanted to paint the whole picture.

The kanto i've tried connecting in 2 ways: Through RCA cables to my topping DX 3 pro DAC and using an aux cord directly to my laptop aux. They sound about the same either way.

audiophile,"I hope this is the correct place to ask this. Heads up, I'm not terribly audio savvy.

I picked up the Anker Q45 headphones, the only other ""serious"" audio purchase I've ever made besides my Edifier 1280T speakers for my pc in 2020.

In the soundcore app, there is a safe volume control option to set a maximum decibel level on the headphones. There is also a decibel reading display, which shows that a song doesn't stay at one decibel level throughout. If I set the safe volume to 75 and put my volume at max so it always stays at that level, does that effect sound quality in any way? Would there be much of a difference if instead I placed my volume below max, so there is cushion for the decibel level to fluctuate?

It feels like an arbitrary question, but I was curious and figured a -phile subreddit was the best place to ask something niche.

On a side note, I had originally chosen 85db after reading that was the safe level. After some more reading, I've found that results are either inconclusive or are widely misinterpreted. I'm curious if anyone can help me understand what's up with that?"

audiophile,"Hi! Hoping to get a bit of help regarding my turntable from anyone who knows more about this than I do. So I just got a Pioneer PL-12D, and initially it was working fine. But now when a vinyl is in, it plays very wavy - when I get down to it's level, the vinyl itself looks warped, though I know the disc itself is not - I tried playing several perfect condition discs. Also, it plays very slowed down. I checked the belt and tried to tighten it by putting it in boiling water, and removed the residue from the deteriorated old one but that didn't help. Do you guys think the belt is the most likely culprit for this kind of problem? I already ordered another belt but I'm not totally confident that's the solution. :("
audiophile,I'm trying to find out what service has better quality  tracks
audiophile,"I Recently purchased 1980 rega 2 with original Acos r200 arm but sadly discovered audio issues at the higher end. Noticed while playing MJ‚Äôs ‚ÄòWanna be starting something‚Äô where the chorus vocals sound scratchy. 
Eliminated speakers, amp, cartridge, and vinyl. 
Anti skate belt is broken (common issue at this age) but seems to be set in correct position. 
Using 2 grams of pressure but heavier weight helps suppress the issue. 

Question is, if anyone has experienced an issue like this and or what the culprit is. Do I need a new tone arm or can I fix? 


Thanks"
audiophile,"I recently inherited my dad‚Äôs old Technics by Panasonic SL-1710 turntable. The needle appears damaged. I found a replacement audio-technica AT14sa cartridge and stylus in his things. 

Looks like they are pretty pricey to replace. Cost isn‚Äôt an issue. But I want to make sure I am preserving what appears like vintage 70s gear, but I also want the best sound from the turntable. 

Is it worth getting a new one, using the vintage replacement one it came with or should I consider changing out the entire head?    

Just got this set up and excited to start listening to his old vinyls the way God intended!"
audiophile,"It's Friday night, your friends are all over for some drinks. Now it's time to show off your cool system.  

What content or music do you use to do so?  Is there a song, or recording that is your ""go to"" to demonstrate the abilities of your system? What about that content highlights how great your gear is? Are there particular details in a track that make your system sound so sweet? 

I wasn't sure if this belongs in this sub, but what good is all your hardware without audio content?

audiophile,"During the home inspection, they had sonos radio playing the same station throughout the house. Each room had a volume knob. It's pretty cool. However, they are taking the sonos. I'm not totally sure how they have it setup, and I'm wondering if I can do some upgrades once I move in.

Here are the pictures I have of their setup:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sws9i1djsvba1.png?width=2548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c0be50c1c492a8c7dd83410e8ddc620bf94f42ee

https://preview.redd.it/iki3e06ksvba1.png?width=2548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2e5156c591d050f83f05d2ee2e4de60d34d00e99

In each room there is typically only one speaker. I was initially surprised when I saw the sonos amp only has a left and right output. So I'm wondering if those are plugged into this ""Monster"" speaker selector, which then sends either left or right (or both?) to each room.

Also, I am thinking the wire was installed with the house back in '98. I am too new to the audiophile scene to know if this is a big deal. Is the wire OK and will it be OK for a while? I know a lot of people like to spend extra money on nicer wiring.

Do you have any ideas for setting up this system? I was thinking of getting the amp and speaker selector first, then upgrading the speakers later. Maybe the bluesound powernode 2021?

Also, **there are one or more speakers outside**, so I'm concerned about power surges or lightning strikes damaging the system. What precautions should I take?"
audiophile,"Equipment:

1. Athena Technology AS-F2 speakers (35hz-20khz +/ 3db, dual 8"" woofers per tower speaker)
2. Audio Engine HD4 (60hz-22khz, 4"" woofers) crossed over at 80hz with Emotiva Airmotiv SE8 FLex (33hz-200hz, 8"" woofer)
3. Shure SE425 (20hz-19khz, IEMs)

I used my old Radio Shack SPL meter to calibrate the SPL meter apps on my phone so that they all agree. What I find is that at the same SPL levels (checking both A and C weightings) the first two sound very different from each other in terms of perceived loudness, despite being calibrated to try and be as balanced as possible in sound for my room.

The towers (#1) sound LOUD and more enveloping!! Even though my measurements tell me they are not any louder than my desktop speakers (#2). I don't think #1 is ""better"" in terms of sound quality than #2, but they sure are more enjoyable to listen to for some reason. I ask because I feel inclined to turn up #2 to get the same ""feel"" as #1. But my SPL meter tells me that's not a good idea (I try not to exceed 82dB as I listen to music up to 12 hours a day).

Furthermore, I have had some tinnitus issues recently with my Shure SE425 (#3). These have not felt louder than #1 or #2, but I have no way of measuring how loud I'm listening to them. The tinnitus seems to suggest it was TOO loud. 

**Is it possible the higher the quality the sound equipment, the LESS loud they sound due to having less distortion, less dynamics, or less surface area to move sound?**

Because if that's the case, then the risk to my hearing would be  Shure SE425s &gt; Audio Engine HD4 &gt; Athena AS-F2. Has anyone else experienced loudness perception differences like this?"
audiophile,"Anyone having any issues with the Wiim mini? I‚Äôm loving mine - sounds great. BUT I‚Äôm having an issue with the Wiim app/tidal connect losing the device.

Then usually the Wiim home app loses contact. It says online, but can‚Äôt connect. Which leads me to think it‚Äôs a software bug, not my wifi.

And this post isn‚Äôt to rag on Sonos sound quality at all, I‚Äôve quite enjoyed the times I‚Äôve spent using those speakers at friends homes. 

My problem is I don‚Äôt want to abandon the fun, unique process of considering the components individually (receiver, speakers, TT, amp, DAC, etc‚Ä¶). Are there solutions on the horizon, or already here that allow for say, multi room/zone wireless playback without noticeable latency? I‚Äôm imagining a series of networked receivers or a main fully-featured receiver and some straightforward networked boxes.

audiophile," **This is a warning for anyone that has considered, or is considering making any purchase fromAPOS Audio, and especially anyone that is tempted by the lower price on their ""APOS Certified"" items.**

APOS Audio's 45-day return policy says, among other things that:

**-You can return any product that you are not satisfied with within 45 days of the delivery date.**

But if you read the Return Policy in its entirety, you will also find that:

**Items marked as ""Final Sale"" are not eligible for a return, unless they are defective.**

Let's talk about this very important, and crucial piece of information:

**APOS Certified items, and the most important point of this post:**

When you purchase an APOS Certified item, there is a banner towards the bottom of the page that advertises it as such:

""Tested and refurbished to look and work like new""

""Eligible for APOS Certified One-Year Warranty""

""Substantial discount with free shipping""

Wow, this APOS Certified stuff sounds amazing, right?

Wrong.

**APOS Certified items are Final Sale items, and are NOT returnable. However, this information is not available anywhere on the product page. There is no fineprint on the bottom that says ""This item is not returnable"". There is no fineprint on the APOS Certified banner that says ""Additional Terms Apply"" or ""Click here for more information""**

**There is absolutely nothing that indicates that APOS Certified = Final Sale**

**The only way to find this information is:**

a) Search on Google for APOS Certified, and it will take you to a page where you can read APOS Certified fineprint, including the fact that it is a Final Sale Product.

b) The banner on the bottom of the page is actually clickable! Most people wouldn't know or realize, because again, there is no ""Click here for Terms and Conditions"" or anything to indicate there is more to see than what they advertise.

**Lastly, APOS Certified is NOWHERE to be seen on their return policy. Nowhere on their return policy does it mention that APOS Certified = Final Sale.**

So a normal customer would read their return policy. See the bit about Final Sales, blah blah, go to the APOS Certified product they want to purchase, and since it doesn't state anywhere that it is a ""Final Sale, non returnable"" item, they purchase said product.

**It is important to note that during the entire checkout process, there are no warnings or notices whatsoever, either.**

**In comparison, if you buy something from Headphones, Final Sale items are clearly marked on the very beginning of the page.**

**APOS Audio is purposely misleading customers into buying products they cannot return, by hiding it behind the ""APOS Certified"" label and making it sound amazing on their product page. Again, their Return Policy makes no mention, whatsoever, that APOS Certified = Final Sale. The words APOS Certified do not exist within their Return Policy page.**

Now, about my own experience:

I purchased a Topping DX7 Pro+, APOS Certified item from them. And as I described above, I read their Return Policy, saw their bit about Final Sale items, and went to the product page... Didn't find the words ""Final Sale"" anywhere, or anything that indicated that this item was not returnable, so I purchased it.

Once I received the item, I used it for a couple of days when I noticed that it was getting unusually hot. The DX7 Pro+ is passively cooled, and the chassis is actually the heatsink, but it was TOO hot. I've owned countless audio devices in the past, and not once had I seen a device get so hot that you can barely touch it.

I contacted APOS. It took them 3-4 days to respond. During that time, I had gone back to my old device, and decided to return the DX7 Pro+

They asked me to measure the chassis temperature and report back to them. I have no way of doing that, and as far as I know, the DX7 Pro+ has no sensors that I can tap into to check the temperatures. I replied accordingly, if anything, it is THEIR job to take the item back, test it, and charge me a restocking fee if they have to.

At this point, I told them I just wanted to return the product. Even IF it was working within normal parameters (I'm certain it wasn't) I wasn't comfortable with it.

They completely ignored my return request, and continued to pretend to want to troubleshoot an item I no longer wanted. After this, I mentioned multiple times that I wanted to return the item. Finally, 4 days after I initially mentioned it, they informed me that the item cannot be returned.

This whole process took around 12 days.

My advice? Stay the hell away. Their Return Policy also states that **""Return Requests made more than 15 days after the delivery date will incur a 20% processing fee""**, and their automated return request system is flawed. If you need to return something, make sure you are very persistent until you get official confirmation that your Return Request was received.

**There is a chance that APOS will revise their pages at some point to correct this, but I have taken plenty of screenshots as proof, in case I need them.**

**I am convinced that I now have a $600 paperweight and that I will not get this matter resolved, but I hope that others that read this post can save themselves the headache (and the cash).**"

audiophile,"Video demonstration here: [https://youtu.be/DQZKHgSAh4Y](https://youtu.be/DQZKHgSAh4Y)

Since I started this journey I have auditioned at least 6 different pairs of the Sony WF-1000XM4, and aside from my original one and a black reference pair that they keep at the Sony customer service center, all of them exhibit an audible feedback in the left bud.

It can only be described as a light pinging sound when active noise cancellation or ambient sound is engaged and the left bud vibrates / shakes either through external physical force (i.e. speaking, snapping your jaw, tapping the bud) or simply when the internal components move while playing anything, really .

Yes you read that right: it can be triggered by playing something through the left bud. It does not even have to be loud. I start hearing the feedback at around 25% volume level.

This phantom feedback or artifact disappears when you turn off noise cancelation or ambient sound, which means it has something to do with the speakers or mics used to listen to the background and generate white noise / amplify ambient sound.

In my opinion, it still remains one of the best sounding TWS earbuds that you can get to date, but you cannot really un-hear it once you know what to listen for. While you can turn active noise cancelation or ambient mode off, it severly limits what is supposed to be a premium grade product meant to appeal to more discerning listeners (call it audiophile if you will).

I have done everything I can to make sure the techs working on my issue are aligned and fully understood the issue, requesting for input from Sony product experts and even asking to meet and have a dialogue. The last response I got went something along the lines of - we are giving you an entirely new pair, and if the artifact is still there, then it really is the nature of the product and all Sony WF-1000XM4 has this issue.

This issue seems to be mechanical, so it is not something to that can be addressed by firmware.

I never found out if it was a localized issue, i.e. one that would affect only a specific ""faulty"" batch. Do you own a Sony WF-1000XM4? Why don't you give it a try? Put it on try snapping your jaw or tapping the left bud several times.

I have now given up, and can only hope that this artifact can be addressed in a future release, hopefully on the Sony WF-1000XM5."

audiophile,"Hello! I'm very new to this world. I just ordered the Audioengine D1 Dac for my computer speakers+sub (Audioengine A5+ speakers and an S8 Sub) after reading about how it really improves the sound. I switch between speakers and headphones throughout the day while I'm working from home and I realize that the Audioengine D1 requires you to plug in/unplug the headphones in order to switch to speakers, is there any sort of 3.5mm adapter that can turn on/off the headphone connection without needing to unplug/plugin every time? I was considering a 3.5mm splitter that has nothing plugged into the second output but would that somehow lower the sound quality?  

Its worth noting my headphones are Sennheiser Drop HD 6XX and they are currently hooked up to a Drop 02 Headphone Amp. I would love to have just one Amp/Dac to drive both my speakers and headphones but is it worth considering using the Audioengine D1 for the speakers and keeping the headphone setup as is?

audiophile,"Possibly a little disturbing to some audiophiliacs, but I'm in the process of doing something similar to what u/Leading-Highway- posted yesterday - using a secondary pair of full-range speakers to add bass. The way I'm thinking of it right now, might be a terrible idea. Or maybe brilliant. Opinions please.

&amp;#x200B;

My setup is a smallish room, home/hobby recording studio. I've got a pair of half-decent nearfield monitors (Tannoy Reveal 8s) driven by a very clinical amp. I did also have a self-powered subbass.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't bad, but the subbass cut off very sharply around maybe 80Hz (thereabouts, should have written it down). Small tuned box, 10"" driver. The overall response was very flat when measured, down to the sub's thing. But to my ears, subjectively, sounded boxy. So when the other week the sub died I was looking for plan B. (I think I can fix the sub, for another room). The Tannoys are very flat on their own, but more like a mid-range level.

&amp;#x200B;

Channeling the 14-year-old me, I ordered what are really low-budget full-range PA speakers, and amp. But unlike  LOUD 14, I just want to add some bass, get clearer monitoring. The bass drivers are 12"", surprisingly small cases (Thomann 'the Box PA12ECO MKII\`).  The specs say 65Hz...15kHz, but without actually saying at what measurement. 

&amp;#x200B;

So how do integrate these? (I haven't done any tests yet (apart from listening) on the PA speakers).

The Tannoys are great down to low-mid. 

I know I need to test. 

But how bad is this idea:

I send the Tannoys the same stuff as they are getting now. I measure where they drop off. I make a passive (resistors + capacitors) low pass filter before the amp for the PA things.

Profit. /strike/ - good sound!

Any sense here? Or will phase or something bite me in the bum?"

These are ran to the left channel, simply because that's how the audio is sent from mainboard (it's a video pinball machine, audio is left mono)

But now I add an 8 ohm subwoofer (really transducer puck) to the subwoofer channel.

Does that single 8 ohm throw the rest of the speakers impedance off if thought it has its own SW channel? 
Or do I need to buy two 8 ohm pucks, wire those parallel to give me 4 ohm?

Is this how to wire this? 4 speakers in series/parallel to left channel, and 2 SW in parallel in its channel for 4 ohm overall?"
audiophile,"I am looking into buying Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless Headphones as my first audio upgrade from AirPod Pro's. I basically constantly have my earbuds in listening to music and my friend suggested I upgrade to the AirMax headphones but I am leaning toward the Sennheisers after some research. I am sensitive to noise so I typically have sound cancelling on during my day to day, but have seen conflicting reviews on the Momentum 4's sound cancelling ability. Im not looking for the best noise cancelling on the market but just enough to drown out people talking in semi-crowded to crowded room. I know that the cheapest the headphones are currently $249.95 on Walmart as a refurbished pair (which I am weary about), while the second cheapest option is $278.12 on Amazon. I am looking out for price drops but am uncertain if there will be any soon. Does anybody have experience with these headphones? Two other things I am looking out for; comfort because I wear glasses (from the research I have done it does not seem that comfort will be an issue) and how it pairs to devices. Thanks!"

audiophile,"I went to a high end stereo store yesterday.  The salesman played a few tracks for me on a $100K+ system that I never heard of before.  The sound was amazingly three dimensional but the actual music was not music I'd ever listen to (or want to listen to again).  I asked him to play some well known rock, but he said there are not many rock songs that are both well recorded and popular.  He put on 'China Grove' and it's true, is sounded terrible compared to the previous tracks he played.  Even ""Aja"" was a far cry from the initial tunes he played for me. My question is, what are your 'go to' tracks for demo-ing HiFis?"

audiophile,"Hello all, complete newbie question here, I am moving into a house with many speakers built into the ceiling in about 3 different rooms. I believe all the speaker wires for these are routed into one small cupboard with a very old amp in it. An electrician has told me it definitely needs replacing and recommended a sonos amp but personally I don‚Äôt like using their app and it is way out of my budget. Can anyone give me a suggestion of what else to get? And also tell me how I would connect all these speakers as after looking at the back of some amps on Amazon, it looks like most have like 2-4 inputs? How would I connect all my other rooms in that case? Perhaps their is a splitter?

Also, I have lots of Alexa‚Äôs so would like one that can link with them and airplay through my iPhone if possible."

Streaming via Spotify/Bluetooth to the same setup I notice it‚Äôs slightly louder and cleaner. While the TT setup is sounds a bit warmer and has a bit of a shrill sound in higher ends. 

I know the biggest weakpoint in my setup is probably the receiver, but at what price point do folks hear noticeable differences from analogue to streaming?

audiophile,"So long story short, recently got an UMIK-1 and Dirac, transformed my speakers completely ([before](https://prnt.sc/yyO37FVWCfoT) &amp; [after](https://prnt.sc/58bRiqzOht7x)) and noticed that since Dirac adds a negative pre-amp value due to the EQ, I needed to push my trusty old NAD C315 from 12-o'clock to 3-o'clock to get to my usual listening-levels.

audiophile,"Hey guys, I live in an apartment with apparently very thin walls, and because of this i‚Äôm attempting to kill off some of the bass that my speakers are pumping out. (yes i know a house would be more ideal, but i‚Äôm stuck in the lease for a year).

My system currently includes an Aiyima power amp, and for speakers, i‚Äôve got Emotiva B1+ bookshelf speakers.

I‚Äôm considering getting a physical EQ to sit between my source and amp to hopefully subdue some of the lower frequencies that are traveling through the walls and disturbing my neighbors.

I‚Äôm very new this this hobby so bare with me please, but i‚Äôve already done a couple things to try to remedy this. One is i‚Äôve put a sock in each of the speaker ports which has helped but not completely, i‚Äôve also put each speaker on a folded towel which i‚Äôm not sure has done anything to help but that was kind of expected.

The EQ i‚Äôm looking at is the Schitt Loki Mini + which has 4 bands - 20hz, 400hz, 2khz, 8khz.

From what I understand, the 20hz band is a range to about 100hz (idk somewhere around there i guess). Would this help with the deep bass frequencies that are getting through the walls?

Sorry if this is confusing, if anyone needs clarification please let me know. I dont know much about this stuff but really would like to figure out a solution that isn‚Äôt ‚Äújust get headphones‚Äù, for now at least.

audiophile,"Hi,   


So I've been enjoying my old B&amp;O record player a lot, but I want to get two turntables so I can mix my vinyl records. I've been eyeballing the Reloop RP-7000's as they fit my budget and basic needs.   


However, I've been getting confused with how to get the best sound quality out of the setup. Most video's I find online feature active speakers, but I really want to use my passive Wharfedale's and Audiolab 6000A amp. And preferably use the phono preamp in the Audiolab and bypass the preamp of the mixer or turntables.  


So my previous setup:   
B&amp;O phono out -&gt; Audiolab 6000A phono in -&gt; 8 ohm speakers.   


New setup:   
2x Reloop RP-7000 phono out -&gt; Mixer Line-In (*my guess is it will bypass the preamps???*) -&gt; Audiolab phono in (activating the pre amps) -&gt; speakers.   


Or is it better to use the mixer's or turntables phono preamp? So:  
Reloop line-out -&gt; mixer line in -&gt; amp line in -&gt; speakers.   


Or:  
Reloop phono out -&gt; mixer phono in -&gt; amp line in -&gt; speakers.   


Anyway, any help is really appreciated.   
Also recommendations on a simple but good sounding mixer is very welcome.   


Thanks."
audiophile,"A friend of mine found a pair of Roger LS5s in his attic and has offered to sell them to me for $60. I'm considering buying them, but can find surprisingly little information for such an apparently legendary speaker.

Most LS5s I see online have the port situated at the top corner of the front baffle, unlike this pair which has the port on the front baffle's bottom.

I haven't been able to find much information. I did provide ChatGPT, the OpenAI chatbot, with several relevant prompts, and its best guess is that they're Roger LS 5/9s. However, the 5/9s I've seen have the port on the front top corner.

Does anyone own a pair of *any* Rogers speakers? Is the sound quality as legendary as I've been reading?

Are these fakes? Or just very rare? Thanks for the help. I don't want to pass up on a potential $1k pair for speakers for $60, but money is tight.

audiophile,"  

Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated here - maybe I am posting in the wrong sub. 

I purchased the Sony PS-LX310 turntable new \~5 months ago and I think I am beginning to regret that decision as I learn more about turntables through this community. I am seeking answers/advice that I have tried researching online and can‚Äôt find any clear-cut answers to.  With that in mind, I am hoping the community might be able to provide some insight without crucifying me. It‚Äôs a pretty basic setup, but here is what I am working with; Sony PS-LX310 turntable, Sony STR-DH190 receiver, and 2 Polk XT60 speakers. 

My questions;

1.) I am learning an upgrade to the cartridge can really improve sound. When reviewing videos of how to change a cartridge I realized that the tonearm on the Sony doesn‚Äôt have a removable headshell. The leads are all soldered in. I did more research on my model and found this form on vinylengine regarding the PS-LX310 ([www.vinylengine.com/turntable\_forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=126175](http://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=126175)). It became pretty clear to me based on the comments in that thread that the real fix here is a new turntable where I can easily remove the headshell, change cartridge, adjust tracking force, mounting position, etc. I can‚Äôt do any of that with the PS-LX310. While that all is unfortunate, I can easily upgrade my stylus for \~$50. My first question; is an upgrade at stylus worth it in your opinion with my turntable? Again, I realize the real fix is a new turntable and I‚Äôll do that in a few years ‚Äì I should have done my research initially, however, is an upgrade at stylus going to produce a better sound in the meantime? Or is the nicer stylus just more durable? What would you do?

2.) My second question is on a preamp is *any* preamp better than no preamp? My turntable‚Äôs RCA‚Äôs are going directly into the stereo receiver. A have an old Pyle Pro PP444 not hooked up. Is using a cheap preamp better than nothing? I do feel like I need to turn up the receiver higher on records than when I am listening to anything digitally. I realize that the real fix here is spending at least $400 on a preamp ‚Äì but what is the real benefit here? There obviously has to be some huge benefit. So, second/last question; is a super cheap preamp better than nothing?"
audiophile,"I am finally getting my office set up together and I wanted to get the best sound possible out of the situation. I got the Wharfedale Linton‚Äôs and love them replacing my Jamo s801‚Äôs. I got a killer deal on a Technics 1500c to replace my Monoprice turntable. I‚Äôm adding a Pioneer cd player that I‚Äôll use as a transport. Right now my amp is a Pioneer vsx832 repurposed htc. Originally I planned on a Yamaha as801 and a total cd11 tribute. That may still happen, but something came up that may possibly require me to use that money. So my question is if that‚Äôs the case would I see much difference if I just ordered a nice dac from Schiit or Geshelli Labs for a couple hundred bucks and ran that through the vsx832 as just an integrated amp? Maybe later using the Rotel a11 or a12 instead of the Yamaha? Or should I just keep using the dac in the Pioneer for now? Appreciate any thoughts. I‚Äôm reasonably happy with the sound for now, though I can see some nice differences when I use the rca inputs with my Fiio m11 Plus especially in terms of some of the very slight harshness/sibilant sounds that peak out now and again. I don‚Äôt mess with tone controls and tend to use pure direct as well."

audiophile,"I have a  Marantz PM 6004 integrated amp + CD 6004 (music via ipad) paired with KEF Q300 bookshelfs for my stereo setup.

The other day I was listening to Golden Gate by The Midnight  on my home theatre (Marantz NR 1608 + Polk Audio TL1600 5.1 + Paradigm Contractor series in-ceiling speakers for atmos + Apple TV 4k). 

Usually my stereo setup sounds the best for any given track. But For the above mentioned track my HT sounded better with far deeper bass. (Not rumble but good deep bass)

Now for my question, 
1.Will adding a sub to my stereo setup add the missing bass?
2. If so how can I connect the sub the amp along with the bookshelf speakers?
3. Will adding a sub impact the audio in such a way that the low end will split from the High freq and Mid bass?"

audiophile,"I'm torn between running subs 

I recently picked up a pair of JBL P40 (it was like 50$ and these are very rare here so i couldnt pass it up) as my first venture into this hobby, it sounded good and the bass was good in my room in a near-field use

But when I moved it into my living room which was larger, it sounded underwhelming, I added an old sony home theater sub and it sounded better.

I've looked up review from someone on these pair of speakers and they too said the bass was good

I'm used to bass heavy setup so I'm wondering if it's just me not being used to a decent setup and how bass should sound and felt a sub is necessary.

So what I'm torn about now is whether I should just listen to the speakers the way it is or whether I should add a sub which changes the way the speaker sounds.

So, what is y'all opinion on running a sub?"

I have a Dual 7"" touchscreen headunit, and the 4 door speakers are Sony 6.5"", I have a Sony xplod amp that is 1200w max running 3 12"" subs. Ik the configuration isn't the best and ain't optimal but I like it. I want to add led strips under the dash to shine on floorboards and under front seats to shine to back floorboard, I want them to flash to the bass only, and be able to manually change to colors. I have tried many options from wiring LEDs straight to amp(burned them), I tried using monster car interior reactive LEDs, and they only flash white because the bass is so high, and the color can't be adjusted for that idk why. I want to be able to have red lights flash to the floorboards in time with the bass. Any help is appreciated"
audiophile,"Hi. How does a relatively small speaker like an Amphion Argon 3S (380 x 191 x 305 mm, 2500usd) compete with a bigger speaker like a Heresy or a KHL 5? I bought mine used and wondering what big speakers bring to the table compared to 6.5'' speakers. Thanks."
audiophile,Does anyone Here has an opinion on the above mentioned speakers? How much Sound difference can really be in the chassis to the TAD? An how can a 4k speaker be ourmatched 25k by Chassis alone?
audiophile,"On a rainy and windy morning in northern New Hampshire, my English professor entered the classroom carrying a single vinyl album under his arm. He looked around at his small group of students sitting at their desks and carefully removed the record from its dust cover. Without making any announcement or scheduling a lecture, he simply introduced the record, saying softly, ""Today, I just want you to listen. Pay attention to the silence.""

He placed the old record on a turntable in the corner, turned it on, and with the precision of a surgeon, lowered the needle onto the record. The vinyl crackled and hissed, revealing its age and dust from years of wear. Everyone was silent. You could hear the rain and wind outside. Then, the music began - Barber's Adagio for Strings, Opus 11, conducted by Leonard Bernstein and played by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Within a few moments, the music filled the room and we were all transfixed by the present and this single piece of music.

After 10 minutes, the performance came to an end. Our teacher raised the needle from the record and looked at our group. ""That is it for today. Class is dismissed.""

Years passed and I attended countless lectures on different subjects. But I never experienced something as profound as this one class on that rainy, windy day. The music stayed with me internally for the rest of the day and for the rest of the week. I would even say that it encapsulated my schooling experience for that year.

It wasn't until decades later that I reconnected with my professor and had the opportunity to ask him the burning question about what piece of music he played for us all those years ago. He responded, ""Adagio for strings, Op 11,"" - but made sure to emphasize that it was the Leonard Bernstein recording, by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.

That single recording and comment led me down a rabbit hole of vinyl listening that I didn't know existed. I have heard innumerable performances of Adagio Opus 11, but it was the Bernstein recording that set itself apart with its use of silence as an instrument. How can the same piece of music be portrayed in so many ways? It's not just the notes on the sheet music or the instruments selected or the musical talent - it's about how a conductor can guide and shape a live performance into something that can't be described but can only be felt.

As a culture, we have stopped listening as much as we used to. It's partially due to our shortened attention spans, but it can also be attributed to the overly-produced and amplified single track recordings that fill our ears. It seems that the louder the better. Silence has become a lost art that induces anxiety when it hangs around for too long.

Yet it's the silence that can make the notes more meaningful. It's the pauses between the notes that balance out the significance that each note conveys.

My question to the audiophile community: What one piece of music started you down the rabbit hole, and why? Cheers!"
audiophile,"I needed a replacement adapter for one of my KEF subs. Was prepared to buy, but within an hour or so had an email from KEF saying they were checking with the warehouse, followed by another shortly thereafter with a tracking number.

audiophile,"Here's my current setup:

- Peachtree Nova500 integrated
- Stand mounted Kef LS50s
- Rel T/7i sub
- Various other input sources

I've been listening to this system for a couple of years and although it sounds very good I do feel like it's missing some ""magic"" or ""musicality"" in some ways that I don't really have the vocabluary to properly express.  Sometimes I feel that when turning up the volume beyond a certain point the sound, rather than getting ""fuller"" just gets ""louder"" which can be somewhat harsh and fatiguing, causing me to turn down the volume even though I can handle ""more"".

I have been reading about pre-amps and whether they change the sound of a system and there seem to be two main strains of thought; No, they just boost a signal for an amp but do not color the sound, and; yes, especially if you introduce a tube pre-amp, your sonics will improve.

I like the idea of a ""tube warmth"" being introduced into the sound and I'm not hung up on whether it is perfectly neutral, I don't mind a bit of sonic sweetening.

Many, many, many years ago I heard a friend's system, which had the quality of filling the space around me with liquid sound the higher the volume was turned up and it never sounded even a tiny bit harsh.  I know I will likely never have the financial wherewithal to achieve that level of sonics but I'd like to tweak what I've got to at least approximate that experience.

As a novice in the ways of audio equipment, and a somewhat broke ass mofo who does not have the ability to ""buy and try"" I figured I'd ask the community for thoughts and feedback to inform my thinking.

Thanks."
audiophile,"I recently could get a pair of Focal Chora 826-D, which are the Dolby Atmos enabled version of the 826.

I will use them only for music and not for Home Theater. I was wondering if a stereo amp would be sufficient (I was looking at the Marantz PM7000N) or if there would really be extra value in getting an AV receiver to enable the Atmos speakers (maybe the Marantz NR1711).

I would be looking for a connected amp.

Thank you for your input!"
audiophile,"My bf and I have a ESSamt1 speaker system which we use daily. Last nye we used it for a small party in our living room (about 35m2) for which we turned up the volume more than usual (3 people, ‚Äò80s music (no hardcore or whatever, if that matters), direct neighbor couldn‚Äôt hear it). Today we found out that the bass sounds very crunchy when we play bass heavy songs. 

I know that speakers can blow up but I always thought that to be the case when the music is extremely loud and that turning up the volume once in a while is in line with it‚Äôs intended use. Bf compares it to doing burnouts for 5 minutes straight with the car, but that comparison seems excessive to me when talking about a good sound system in a small room. 

My question is: is this to be expected when turning up the volume (for ~ 2,5 hours) or is my speaker faulty?"

audiophile,"I was so excited to get these - my first proper headphones. I own some Bose 700s / AirPods Pro which I always thought were pretty great but I was interested to try something better. 

First listen to the new cans, I didn't really notice that much of an improvement. Decided to listen through the full Kid A album and it was only when I got to Treefingers (a track I've never really cared for before) that all of a sudden I felt like I was in some kind of audio dream world. It was just a beautiful soundscape. So I tried some A/B testing and sure enough, my Bose 700s simply sound awful now. So blurry, so muddy, so immensely unimpressive. The AirPods sound like some kids toy. 

The HD600s have just dramatically raised the ceiling that I didn't know was there. I'm absolutely delighted with them but in a funny kind of way I almost wish I hadn't ever discovered how much better things could be. Goodbye to ANC, I suppose! I've a lot of listening to do."

audiophile,"Hi, I am looking for some speakers in my apartment to listen to music from my PC.

I have the Logitech Z200 but the sound quality is horrible. It feels like they tried to cram bass into the entire sound. Mids and highs are almost nonexistant (it's just 50% ""womp womp"", maybe it's the weird passive radiator. I tried literally every setting). Even my smartphone/laptop speakers produce a clearer sound.

I don't know if it should be 2.0 again or 2.1 (the sub might be a problem). Otherwise I am really not a person who turns up the bass that much. I hate bass heavy music. I like a clear sound, clear mids (and highs?). Maybe 2.1 is better as the bass is clearly separated and adjustable? In general, any speaker recommendations?"
audiophile,"My RHA T10i in-ear headphones are getting kinda stale. Any suggestions on potential IEM upgrades under ¬£/$500?

I was looking into the Sennheiser IE 300/600 range, and then was consumed by a deluge of chi-fi earphones to choose from on Amazon for dirt cheap (moondrop, KZ, etc.). Do any discerning listeners have opinions on how these cheaper phone‚Äôs drivers stack up to the staple brands like Shure? Or even high end stuff like Astel and Kern or Campfire?

It has that ‚ÄúV shaped‚Äù sound profile, meaning it‚Äôs more focused on bass and treble than on mids, which usually to me indicates a less nuanced or low quality driver.

audiophile,"Ok, I love my music but I'm not an audio expert. I love listening to music at low volume in the background. Some of this music is electronic and some vocal. And I'm thinking of adding a sub-woofer to my Hi-Fi a Denon F109. (I already use a TV soundbar as a speaker.)  Because from my research it would seem that sub-woofers are really good at low-frequency sounds. 

But, most of the sub-woofers I've looked at seem to be huge and high-wattage devices. This seems counter-intuitive to me. Surely, for low-frequency sounds a speaker that is physically smaller and uses less wattage is going to be much more suited to the job?"

audiophile,"I currently have ""Aiwa Nsx s708"" connected to my tv to use the speakers. I am currently moving and want to get rid of the main station (idk how this is called. The big box where everything gets plugged in and has all controls) because the display isn't working anymore, only half of the buttons are still working and I don't use any other feature this thing has.

Now my question is, are those speakers still good to use like are those still good budget speakers? I really like the sound but since those are very old maybe it isn't seen as good anymore. So if those where still good, I would buy some new main station of possible that isn't a big block like the original (and also has a working remote).

2. Does a small Mainstation exist where I could connect those speakers to connect them to my tv?"

\[Sorry, noob question I guess\]. 

I just set up my music/HT gear consisting of:

* \[AVR\] Denon S760H
* \[Front\] KEF LS50 (1st gen)
* \[Center\] KEF R200c
* \[Sub\] SVS-SB1000
* \[Surround\] Monitor Audio Silver FX

I've been reading lots of audio-related articles/reddit discussions, but one thing I'm not sure I'm getting is how to set up Low Pass Filter (Crossover Frequency) on my sub right. 

I understand the theory that essentially it says what't the highest frequency that subs plays so that everything above it are handled by other speakers and it blends nicely, but the user manual of my SVS says ""For connection to an A/V receiver, the low pass should be set to LFE (i.e., disabled)"" which is what I did since I have an A/V receiver and then ran Audyssey calibration.

It seems to be working fine, although I feel like the bass is on the weaker side, although it definitely blends nicely.

Am I doing this right or wrong? Any advice appreciated, thank you!"

audiophile,"Hey, complete audio noob here. Be easy on my ignorance.

I‚Äôve been using Bluetooth headsets for quite the majority of my PC gaming career. Never noticed much of an issue. But the true aficionados of audio in general, not just gaming seem to avoid Bluetooth. 

So, if I‚Äôm giving myself less of an edge in competitive gaming I want to get that fixed.

Now, I was reading a discussion here on Reddit that was proposing Creative BT-W4‚Äôs dongle as a potential solution.

I‚Äôve received it in the mail and plugged it into my PC. 

I‚Äôm wondering a couple of things‚Ä¶ 

1. Does this seem like something that will improve the viability of Bluetooth for high quality audio in gaming and otherwise?

2. I‚Äôm too dense to understand if I need to somehow manually apply this device to my device I‚Äôm using to receive audio. For example on my PC, do I need to somehow select my AirPods Pro‚Äôs or my AirPods Max headphones to be connected with the Creative BT-w4 dongle? Or will it be automatic.

Understand completely if this is the wrong place to ask #2, but if this truly is a useful device for BT audio I‚Äôd assume someone here is knowledgeable on how to use it.

My question for you guys is if you only had around $1200 in the budget for the gear upgrade would you suggest I keep using the iMac for streaming source and just upgrade the DAC to maybe the Denafrips Enyo and keep using Apple Music, or would you recommend getting something like the CXN v2 and switch to Tidal?

audiophile,"Like it makes no sense. I have the emotiva b1+, a Dolby atmos receiver which powers the speakers. That‚Äôs it. I spent 250 on the speakers, 120 on the receiver (used) and the rest was cables. 

My dad has the Revel F206, the anthem mrx 740 receiver and an outlaw amp. He also had a fluance turntable which he uses occasionally. He also has a klipsch sub. 

I visited for about 24 days for winter break and I listened to it everyday. It was really good after a few days of listening and had a much larger amount weight behind instruments. However, it‚Äôs imaging was so bad compared to my current setup. Like abysmal. I just came back and the fact that the center image is so separated from the rest and every instrument sounds 2x as natural is absurd.

* Connect TV Bookshelf Speakers to Sonos Connect (through Denon Heos Amp). Then get Sonos speaker for kitchen. Outdoor would be all set

Still in box, all accessories, etc.  I was very excited to do a side by side comparison and get it in installed into my system: McIntosh MA6300, Rega P3 - Ortofon LVB Cartridge, KLH Model 5 (New Ones) speakers.

First impression while listening to my Cambridge Audio Streamer was the music sounded more buttery and the the depth was increased.  There is absolutely no noise between tracks or notes now, which was nice.  Then I decided to take TOOL - Fear Inoculum for spin.  I was blown away at the increased sharpness of the highs.  The mids seemed to come to life a bit more.  Overall, I am now a believer, and yeah I know there are much higher end units, (This one retails for 750 on Crutchfield) and some will say its all Placebo.  But I personally can hear a difference, seems like there is a bit more depth and clarity in the imaging.  I am no longer in the ""Power is Power"" camp, and now questioning my cheap Monoprice speaker wire and power cables.  LOL.  Best 200 bucks spent on my system!!

audiophile,"Hi All,  


I hope that this post is within the rules, as I do not need specific technical or purchase help, but am moreso looking for information as this amplifier seems a bit mysterious and lacking information.  


I inherited an Audiomat Arpege from my late father several years ago. I had not been able to get it setup until yesterday, however now that I have it setup and am doing some research I have some questions on how to best care for this piece of equipment. I am a novice as it pertains to hi-fi analog equipment, but would like to learn as much as possible.  


I believe that the model I have is the original 1999 model, as there is no ""Reference 10"" text at the bottom. From what I can tell, this is what would differentiate the two.  


Questions:  


1. I can not seem to find any information on how I might replace the vacuum tubes. I've also read on some forums that I might need to directly contact the retailer so that they can match specific tubes to serial numbers on some Audiomat equipment. Does anyone know of retailers in Canada or Ontario? I am in Toronto, and as far as I am aware from forums, the only Canadian retailer was a person in Quebec who ran Mutine, who is now retired. If that is the case, it seems this may be very hard to service.
2. Can I change the tubes myself or must I bring this to a professional? 
3. Is this piece of equipment rare? Given the lack of information, it seems rather mysterious, and I have spent several hours trying to find details about it. I think that it sounds good, but I have no clue how this stacks up against more contemporary equipment. From what I can see, the ""Reference 10"" are well reviewed, but I can find very little information on the 1999 models, aside from a few old reviews that rave about the sound quality.

Any advice here is appreciated, and I hope I am within the rules posting this.

Thank you!"

audiophile,"Hi guys, I‚Äôm new to this Reddit so I hope this is an acceptable post. 

To start, I have an AVR7200 that I absolutely love, however I have a few stereo channels that have gone bad on it, FR and SR, the Subwoofer pre out is also bad on it.

Is it going to be easy enough to repair the pre out (I have experience working with electrical systems in car audio, namely repairing amplifiers) and adding an amplifier? Or would I be better off looking to repair the internal amplifiers?

I am also looking at this from a budget standpoint, because I‚Äôm okay with spending money on an amplifier, however, I‚Äôve been looking at the BasX A5 which has a 90 watt output while the HK 7200 has a 100 watt all channels driven output. 

I guess a bonus question would be, is an external amplifier going to give me more benefits than the 10 watts would make up for, or would I be better off repairing the internal amplifier on the HK 7200. 

Either option I would be going with I would still be looking into the subwoofer preout. 

Also if anyone would have a source on finding parts for this little exploration into home audio repair I‚Äôd greatly appreciate that as well."

Listening i could hear the improvement, the measurements were just less dramatic than what i expected. Still work to be done under 300hz, i don't think the 2"" panels are going to help me down there. Satisfied with what's going on above 1.5khz, pretty clean line i think.

Spectral no longer stock boards for this older equipment, and I won't be able to get a repair estimate until I ship it to them for evaluation. The cost of transportation and an estimate of the repair bill will almost certainly exceed the unit's present value. I have a local technician who is capable of performing the repair, but Spectral does not release schematics or component information. We're attempting to identify the components, but as you can see, the damage renders some of them unidentified. As a result, I'm stuck with a nice, albeit overbuilt paperweight.

audiophile,"I dipped my toes into mid-fi tubes with the Muzishare XT3. I tried a few entry level hybrids like xDuoo MT-602 and Schiit Vali 2+ but they did not scratch the tube itch for me. Amazon had this unit for \~$900 but was out of stock for awhile. I purchase this via ChinaHiFi for \~$650 shipped back in May. When I received it, plugged it in to test it for an hour. I had a work from home situation so there was not a lot of room on my desk so it sat boxed up in the corner for a few months. 

Fast forward to Nov 2022, I had ordered a bunch of tubes to see what this tube rolling thing is about. I'm not sure if it was me doing something wrong or the unit itself, it started smoking. I turned it off and reached out to ChinaHiFi. Silence for two weeks. I tried again and got a response from the owner. He forward my inquiry/concerns to the warranty people (Muzishare?). After some pictures  and back and forth with troubleshooting I end up sending my unit to China HiFi warranty center in Racine, WI. \~$65 out of pocket for me. 

I received an email from technician last week, stating he replaced burnt capacitors and gave me new EL84 tubes. Everything tested sat and awaiting burn period before shipping it back to me. 

I received my unit two days ago. It's running fine now. Being new to tubes, I'm not sure what happened. Did I do something wrong; was it a faulty capacitor or tubes that shorted the unit; poor quality control or design? I dunno. The warrant came in handy but I had to pay out of pocket for shipping.

How does it sound? True what I read about EL84 tubes: rolled off at the top, lower-mids are more pushed forward, bass has authority but does not dig deep, soundstage does not extend, and micro-dynamics is a little subdued. The background is not black. Running via speaker taps does improve SQ a bit from the balance input in the front and the single ended input in the back. Power is controlled and plenty for dynamic drivers and less hungry planars. The volume pot can be more refined. It has a slight imbalance from 0 -5% but does go away. It's probably measurable but not an issue while listening at normal volume. Max volume for me is at 9-10 o'clock. Maybe I'm spoiled with stepped volume pots but the one here is meh. 

I still have not yet tried it with all my cans to see what pairs well. So far, I can confirm that the HE6SE V2 does not pair well. Senn 58X is borderline muddy. 

Being so new to tubes, I am a little nervous and cautious with tube rolling with \~12 different sets pre and power tubes I collected so far. 

I am enjoying the unit so far. It could be better. But it could be a lot worst. It's all apart of the journey I guess."

The Klipschs seems to be better for this use. But i think seeing long term the Klipsch could bei annoying for me with music. I dont like a cold sound. But as i only listening to music at weekends, maybe its direct sound wouldnt annoy me that quick? 

Other Option are the q Acoustics. Anyone know how they suit with my needs? 

I also considering buying a sub after that, thinking to get a better overall sound with my complicated room acoustics. 

So what do you think should i buy? Arent the elacs maybe that bad for Movies? Can someone tell me their experience with the Klipschs?"
audiophile,Hi all! I have been trying to set up my 4 monitor system for quite some time now. I used to run it through a Presonus central station into my Apollo twin. However I wanted to ditch thunderbolt so I got a UA Volt 476P thinking I could just plug 4 monitors in output. However it didn‚Äôt seem to work that way‚Ä¶ so now I‚Äôm stumped. Is the only way to get 4 to work to buy another central station? Or any tips? I can technically return the UA volt if I made a mistake here. Thanks in advance for the help.
audiophile,"Hi

I've purchase a set of Wharfedale Evo 4.3 speakers and sorry if it's a basic question but they note impedence as: Nominal 8 and minimal 4.4

On my Yamaha amp there's a setting which says low and hi

4 ohms or higher is low

6 ohms or higher is high

I'm confused. I presume I put it on low?

Thanks"
audiophile,"Hi, I'm looking for a single powered speaker to put on a side table. It'll just be used to listen to music. Want wifi and Bluetooth as well as digital/usb input at low/mid volumes. Don't care if it's 'smart'. 

Seems to be a lot of options: Denon henos home speakers (150, 250 etc), marshall stanmore ii, klipsch the threee ii, various sony speakers, (srs-ra3000), sony ssc8, etc. 

For reference this is what I have and what I think of them:

Yamaha NXN500 - sound amazing, like the musician is in the room

audioengine A2 - sound alright. Nothing spectacular.

Sennheiser HD6-- - they're alright, but I don't get what the fuss is about  

Bose Flex - sorta sounds bad, but can't expect much from something so small."
audiophile,I play piano and I‚Äôm looking for a headphone under $300 that can accommodate the range of a digital piano as well as support dolby atmos on iTunes. Does anyone have any recommendations?
audiophile,"I am using cheap dollar store rca cables for everything. I have a Sony STR-AV770X reciever and a pair of Sony SS-CS5 bookshelf speakers. They may not be considered anything too high end or ""audiophile"" but they are what ive got. Ive read plenty of posts regarding how expensive cables dont do anything in terms of audio quality and the money should be spent elsewhere. However I am legit using cheap dollar store thin cables so I think anything remotely decent would be a step up. Correct me if im wrong and if going from dollar store cables to slightly decent cables is a waste of money. Thanks in advance!"
audiophile,"I am presently running a small, heavily treated room with small Amphion nearfields plus dual SVS SB-1000 subs running in stereo, split with a hardware crossover, treated w/ Dirac running on a PC.

Waterfalls are tight, response is great at the desk position, and it sounds excellent. 

I'm troubled by something though - phase response and impulse response in the subs is wonky probably partly because of the DSP onboard the SVS subs - I measure a group delay of 16ms at 60Hz, which seems massive. Some of that is probably due to physics though? Dirac corrects for some time skew but this would be too large without introducing weird latency elsewhere in the system.

First of all - is this something I should care about?

If so - is there anything along the lines of the SB-1000 that is just analog the whole way through (price + performance)? In every other way it's a great sub for my purposes so I'm loathe to mess with a working system.

Thanks!"
audiophile,"I don‚Äôt know a thing about audio but really wanted some studio monitors and found these Adam T5Vs for a good price (and from the recommendation of a musician/producer friend who says they‚Äôre awesome). They sound great and work perfectly except for the fact that I‚Äôm constantly trying to find the right volume for each monitor by manually turning the knobs until they sound about even. Is there something I can buy and hookup to the monitors that will let me ‚Äúsync‚Äù their volumes to make it more convenient? From a quick google search it seems like maybe an interface or a sound card could be the answer but I have zero clue what those are and if they‚Äôd solve my problem. 

Thanks for any help and sorry for my complete lack of knowledge."
audiophile,"Does anyone have experience with bowers 702 signatures? Any pro or cons vs the regular s2 or the new s3? Really curious to know if anyone has demoed the 702 signature vs the 804 d3.

audiophile,I've communicated with a seller who has a pair of these speakers that he's willing to sell to me for just $80 - do you all think that's a good price? What wattage amp might I pair these passive speakers with? Thanks in advance!
audiophile,"So, i know that a properly set up $100,000 would sound better than a $5000 set up (mostly likely).

at what price point does it really not matter?  $60,000?   I feel like, what is the difference between a $10,000 amp and a $30,000..

does a $30,000 really sound any different than a $6,000 turntable?

i likely don't have a golden ear maybe compared to others, but  does it really sound much better or just ""different""??"
audiophile,"I‚Äôm trying keep noise out/in of a small window that‚Äôs 2x4 feet. What would be more effective? A sheet (or 2) of Rockwool acoustic insulation, or a thick rubber floor matt? 

Additional info: I do realize this will not ‚Äúsoundproof‚Äù the room. I‚Äôm just trying to block or at least muffle sound. The sound in question will NOT be low frequency bass sounds. And whatever I choose needs to be removable, as I need access to the window at times. So I‚Äôm considering either rigging the Rockwool in a cushion cover and Velcroing it to the outer edge of the window. Or doing the same with a thick rubber matt. Thank you for your help."
audiophile,"A tweak should never make or break a system, but nonetheless, the cumulative benefits of tweaks can really enhance our listening experience.
Please share with other users the best tweaks you made to your system!

For me it was a Plixir Power Conditionner for my digital front end ( DAC/ Streamer). The sound got so much more relaxed, laid back, liquid, without any loss of details or dynamic. I still can‚Äôt believe how much better it sounds. It removed any itch I could have to upgrade my DAC.

What is yours?"
audiophile,"I personally experienced somewhat softer presentation along with less sibilance and harshness in the treble.

How about you?"
audiophile,"If you are still using the stock mesh earpads change them ASAP, I just changed back to the velour earpads and Gawd Daym the difference is HUGE make it feel more like closed back headphones and brings lower more, I'm really happy I decided to test it out after getting a new soundcard + perfect eq settings I was still craving for something and this definitely sealed the deal for me."
audiophile,"I'm trying to separate my audio jacks on the back of my B550M motherboard so they play different sounds, not a surround sound system. For example, I want my black audio jack to play my YouTube audio and my green audio jack to play Spotify. How do I set this up? Thanks."

audiophile,"My current speakers are Logitech Z523 that I got a long time ago as a gift. I am in the process of upgrading my setup and recently ordered a Fluance RT82 and was planning on getting the Sony 190 to go with the table. 

I like the idea of getting an integrated receiver instead of just getting a preamp, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be able to connect the Sony receiver to my speakers without getting a power+power thing going on. I am of course planning on upgrading the speakers one day but haven‚Äôt done any research on that yet so I just wanted to stick with my current speakers for a while. 

So would it make more sense to go with a receiver or just get a nice preamp for now? Thanks in advance"
audiophile,"Hi there, I just received my Loxjie A30 and I would like some help to pick a pair of speakers, my budget is around 100 to 120 USD, any used or brand new recommendations are welcome.

As well I enjoy a lot of rock music. I'm new to this hobby so that's why I'm looking for help. A bonus would be if you can also recommend me a DAC used or brand new for under 100 to pair with my setup.

audiophile,"As it is right now, my boomshelf sleakers and sub are clustered together on a coffee table along the 12ft right wall in my bedroom, facing the door. I know this is so very far from optimal that it hurts to type out let alone read so bare with me, as I am very new to audio and only graduated from headphones to speakers and a sub about a month ago, so I'm not quite education on everything yet.

As it stands currently, I'm in the middle of finding the right eq and volume settings for my polk xt15 bookshelves and polk psw10 active sub(i know, i know, but it was the cheaopest entry level sub I could get my hands on).

I can attach photos of my room and the obstacles in my way but right now I just want to know if my sub will perform better for hifi on the ground, which is carpeted, or the coffee table, which is steady enough that it does not vibrate(to my knowledge?) it or distort more than I already expected... but it still does distort.

Should I slap the bad bitch on the ground and call it a day for now, or move it around on the few other elevated surfaces I have available?"

audiophile,Discovered this track this morning.. love a good recording and female vocal. I think this track will be added to frequent rotation. What do you think?
audiophile,"Let me start off and say that I'm an absolute noob Audiophile. I'm hoping you guys can share some of your knowledge, please, so I can better understand. 

I recently got myself some IEMs (KZ-ZSN Pro). A Christmas present from me, to me. I was so impressed with the sound quality while listening to music on my phone that I decided to try them on my Desktop PC.

Imagine my disappointment when the volume produced by plugging them into my PC was nowhere near the volume of my phone (SAMSUNG FE 22). 

My question, after reading and watching a few videos on YouTube: Do I need an Amp for my desktop to get the volume as high as the volume on my phone?

TL;DR:
My KZ-ZSN Pro IEMs volume is louder (has more volume) on my phone than on my Desktop PC. Do I need an Amp for my desktop?"
audiophile,"The headphone has active and passive impedance, when ANC is activated and it's connected via the cable, does it have the active or passive impedance?

I can see that it has a better range and higher impedance than the HD 650, and I want to use the Momentum 4 with the cable + the Dragonfly Cobalt, instead the HD 650, so that I can use it as wireless too without the cable.

Will it sound better with the cable and the Dragonfly Cobalt than the HD650 with its cable and the Dragonfly Cobalt?

Some articles say that when using them with the cable, there's passive impedance for the Momentum 4, since its built in amp is not activated, but I think it's only not activated when the ANS is turned off..."

But, yesterday I inherited a pair of B&amp;W Concept 90 CM1/CM2‚Äôs from my parents. I have been listening to them, with and without the subs and I think they have a better sound stage than the Harbeths. 

Is there a consensus as to which speakers are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù or is it all personal preference?"
audiophile,"So I'm starting a new business and I want to start it by starting an audio upgrade rental service using subs , I'm getting this offer at a store for 2 JBL PRX818 , Each sub costs around 1444$ at the store, I see on sweet water that it's on sale for 899$ . But I don't live in the states , I live on an island so even if I buy it online , I'd have to pay for shipping/handling/tax , so my question is , am I getting these at a decent price? And are they good speakers? I've heard a lot online that you need to turn the gain up all the way to make them sound good but the guy from the store told me that it has a default limiter so that it doesn't damage itself , I feel like I'm getting these speakers at a decent price , but I just wanna confirm with more people just to be sure since I feel like I'm not super seasoned on this. I just want to know I'm making a good decision and I'm not just getting scammed . The guy on the store is also offering fixing the speakers for a lifetime if needed , I just need to take them to the store , and if the woofer is damaged I'd just need to get the woofer on its own wich should be around a 300$ fix but that's future stuff"
audiophile,"Currently running 2 outdoor speakers via Zone 2 from a Denon s760h. The receiver is mainly for the living room running a 5.1.2 setup. Basically the heights and the outdoor speakers are wired to a speaker switch and I have to flip it between the heights/outdoor speakers, as well as switch between Preset 1 on the AVR (5.1.2) and Preset 2 (5.1 + zone 2). It works fine, but I was hoping to simplify the setup.

I've found 2 network mini amps that support airplay v1 (Fosi T10, Arylic A50+). Aside from those, would Reddit have any other suggestions or should I keep the setup the way it is?

audiophile,"Hi all,

Those of you of a certain age may recall this mystery of either marketing hype or real performance (I‚Äôm not sure which).

But if you search ‚Äúb&amp;w and Rotel‚Äù you‚Äôll find many format posts from late 2000s etc touting Rotel and B&amp;W as ideal pairings.

Many years ago, I followed this lead and I have a basic system consisting of:

Turntable: Music Hall MMF 5.1 with Ortofon Blue cart

Integrated amp: Rotel RA-1062

Speakers: B&amp;W 685

audiophile,"Hi there! I purchased a vacation rental home that has in wall speakers throughout the house (12 speakers).

All speaker wire has 4 wires and terminates in a basement control room. The previous owner took whatever setup was there. 

I would like to offer my guests the opportunity to enable audio while they are in the home. I‚Äôm struggling to understand the best way possible to configure this. In my ideal setup a guest could stream Spotify or Pandora from their phone (preferably over wifi and not Bluetooth) to a zone of their choosing. I believe there will be 5 zones total (2 bedrooms, main living area/kitchen, front balcony outdoor area, backyard).

I can‚Äôt figure out the simplest way to do this, would I use a speaker selector and an amplifier/stereo receiver? Would I purchase a wifi amplifier for each group?What about a wifi speaker selector that then connects to an amplifier? 

I‚Äôm looking for something budget friendly (under $500) as this is just a vacation rental.

Additionally, most amplifiers I‚Äôm finding only have 2 pairs of speaker hookups, can I double up speakers on the same terminal?

audiophile,"Hello everyone,

I have two sunfire true signature EQ's 12's I got several years ago used. They were outstanding subs and gave me everything I was looking for. Problem is they both broke and apparently their is only one company that works on these and they can't guarantee it would be fixed even if I shipped both to them. Both got hot and stopped working several months apart.

Really miss having my subs but don't know what's a solid option. Those being 20 year old subs there has to be comparable options that's aren't close to the msrp of those. Right?

Mainly using for music and love a clean deep / heavy bass when I want it. I listen to a plethora of genres. Something that can pressurize the room and provide heavenly sub notes... Just like those Carvers did... 

Worth the gamble to fix these or don't waste my time? If so what's a good option to replace these with?

For reference, I paid $1250 for them about 4 years ago with sub stands and wouldn't want to spend much more than that right now.

So for those not familiar with the Polk's they basically mount into the plywood like a can light would. Is there anything you guys can recommend to dampen the vibrations from happening?

audiophile,"I have what I consider to be a pretty solid system but have struggled with the imaging of the system due to an unavoidable recessed door right at the first reflection point on my left side which pushed the phantom center imaging of my 2.2 system to the right. I had worked with REW and was able to time align the speakers with convolution filters in Roon which was great, but didn't solve the issue with my analog rig. **I was using an NAD M12 which is IMHO and incredible preamp for sound quality. I could set the balance to the left but that butchered my stage.**   
I could have used a MiniDSP 2X4 to help with the corrections for just the analog but I really wanted an all-in-one solution for filtering and time-alignment. **Enter the MiniDSP SHD.** The installation was really simple due to my previous work with REW. I connected everything up with the path being NUC(roon)&gt;Pontus II&gt;SHD, RT-85&gt;Darlington MP-7&gt;SHD all into NAD M12&gt;Rotel RB-1070&gt;R700's/2Xspeedwoofer 10s. Installed the needed software on my old Macbook Air and connected the UMIK-1 to the laptop. Took a ton of measurements to get really comfortable with DIRAC Live and its filtering. After some initial trial and error (okay a lot), I had four presets set up for the SHD. I did some initial listening and I kid you not, all of the imaging problems I was experiencing were gone. **Simple, wonderful, and beautiful sound.**   
The next step was to start experimenting with the half-a-dozen configurations that are now possible for my equipment due to the SHD having a built-in Roon endpoint, Volumio Qobuz direct, and Roon analog in from my Pontus II. After hours and hours of trial and error along with enough A, B, and C comparisons of Wasserman's and Warnes Ballad of a Runaway's Horse to make me question my sanity, I settled on the following configuration...  
**NUC&gt;Pontus II (digital) which also handles my optical for tv audio and RT-85&gt; Darlington MP-7 out to the SHD**... and that's it! I tried both the NAD M12 and a Freya + w/NOS GTA/GTB tubes before and after the SHD and that little @$%&amp; SHD beat them both as a stand-alone preamp going to the amp and out to the subs/speakers.   
After more than two years of work on this system, **I am finally happy with both the sound and functionality of my system for both analog and digital.** I apologize for long post, but I hope my journey will be of use to someone and maybe help them save a bit of money if my experience can help.

audiophile,"Greetings everyone!

I am setting up a speaker system for a project and am using a 2.1 amplifier with 8 ohms. I have two questions

1. 2.1 amplifiers would have three channels: L, R, and Woofer correct?
2. So for the impedance, is each channel allowed to have eight ohms in the speaker output, or is it added together? For instance, can L, R, and woofer (respectively) have 8 ohms, or do the ohms of L, R, and woofer have to add up to 8 ohms, total? 

Thanks so much!"
audiophile,"(I'm new to all this so forgive my possible misunderstandings). I have done my own research but I'm reading contradictory things I can't seem to understand.

Received my SVS SB-1000 Pro yesterday, to pair with my Kef Q150, Loxjie A30. I understand the sub goes down to 20khz. I set the LPF at 80khz and Phase at 0.

I'm in a small, narrow room(5 meter x 2 meter). In a standard desktop PC setup. Both speakers &amp; the subwoofer are less than 1m away from me.

I normally play music at 40-55db(used my SPL meter). everyday for 12+ hours a day(Remote job). I always like to have low volume and play it safe to prevent further hearing damage.

Excited to try my first subwoofer, I played: -15db on the SVS Sub and 45-55 DB on the KEF speakers(100% volume on my PC) for 8+ hours yesterday and it sounded unreal, my left ear started to hurt today due to the bass(So I've stopped for now).

* How loud is 0DB? And when you go down -1DB, -2DB, -3DB..-10DB etc. How do you workout how loud in SPL that is?

* What frequencies, associated loudness and amount of time listened to of which can cause hearing damage? What should I limit my bass DB to?

* What different ways are there of measuring bass loudness? (So I don't go too high)."

I always, always, need to have music everywhere I go.

It‚Äôs a remedy really. It drags me out of the physical and makes me relax or focus.
I get uncomfortable if there‚Äôs a dead silence.

It al started a couple years ago where I was into ‚Äòdj-ing‚Äô for family party‚Äôs and birthdays of friends. Some of you probably have been there. I got a pioneer headphones dj2000, if i remember correctly, and it changed my world. (Lol, no hate pls)
Next i got a pair of yamaha hs8‚Äôs which was a complete different musical experience. The purity got me hooked and they have never turned off since then.
The amount of jazz those monitors had to endure are unspeakable.

For work I got a sony wh-1000xm4 because all hardstyle fans said they produce grungy kicks and muddy bass. Oh they do for sure.

Today I impulsively bought a Audio Technica AT-LPW40WN record player to hook up with the Yamaha‚Äôs through a yamaha wxc-50 streamer.
Still doubting to get the hs8s subwoofer as well..

I have no idea what is going on or what all these terms everybody keeps talking about mean.

audiophile,"I‚Äôm trying to make sense of wattage and how it translates to what I end up hearing, how loud or distorted. 

I‚Äôve been using a cheap Sony STR-DE597 for a while now which has 110W per channel, apparently. It gets loud, but nothing too crazy. I‚Äôve been using that to drive some 5‚Äù 2-way bookshelf speakers and it‚Äôs been ok. 

I recently bought a pair of old B&amp;O S45-2 speakers to have as a non critical pair for my turntable, a [Wega 3203FET with Dual 1215](https://www.hifi-wiki.de/index.php/Wega_Studio_3203). This has a 25W built in amp, but when driving the B&amp;O speakers it sounds a lot louder at a fraction of the volume slider and sounds much better to boot. The Sony just kills any dynamics these speakers have and struggles to provide it with any bass. 

What am I missing here. How is a 110W amp struggling to properly drive a pair of 45W speakers but a 25W amp has no issues getting it to sound loud and good?"

audiophile,"Hello members,

If you are like myself and have been on a waiting list from Magnarisers for stands and are pulling your hair out, I wanted to share some advice.

I did not realize the Magnepan MMG (the outgoing entry level Magnepan before the LRS), has the same spacing for the brackets for the stand. Knowing that opened up some new alternatives to find stand options. I found a distributor that has MMG stands available now, as opposed to not even knowing when your product will arrive as per Magnarisers.

The vendor I found is called [Maggiesparadise](http://www.maggiesparadise.com/products/), I know it sounds like an elicit site but it's a genuine speaker stand site. The stands should work for Magnepan LRS, LRS+ and MMG.

If I didn't find the above site I was going to just go DIY. I'm sure Magnerisers is a fine company but after 3 months on the waiting list and the order not even in production yet, I decided to pull out. Hopefully, this helps some Magnepan users. I'm not affiliated with the above at all, simply a consumer hoping to help others."
audiophile,"Hey guys, I'm currently testing two sets of stereo speakers out at home and while I was able to dismiss a previous pair that I was testing fairly quickly, I'm having a hard time right now. 
Problem is, they sound quite different but neither of them sounds clearly better to my ears. I know, it's always said that most important is that they sound natural but I'm also having troubles picking which one does that better.

Since I'm not an expert at all and this is the first time im doing this, maybe you guys can help me out and tell me if one of those actually sound the way the speakers are supposed to sound.
Both are ""bothshelf"" speakers and cost around 400 euros. One German brand, Nubert, and a danish Brand, Argon.
Not sure if any of that matters or these brands are even known outside of Europe, but at least here they are well reviewed and recommended.


Speaker A is able to get ""much lower"", has a stronger bass. Using Nocturne by Daft Punk to test the bass, Speaker A does create quite a rumble, would almost fool me into thinking there's a subwoofer somewhere in the room, wouldnt have expected that from those little guys.
Meanwhile Speaker B doesn't nearly get that low, the rumble is just quite far away.

Instinctively I would say 1-0 for Speaker A since, atleast right now, I don't plan on getting a subwoofer as bass is just not that important for me personally since I don't listen to super bass heavy music such as EDM for example.

The other big difference is the treble.
Speaker B seems to just sound much ""higher"" than A. If I had to visualize it, I would say it sounds as if the Singer or, during a guitar solo, the guitarist is standing 5 meters closer to me than the rest of the band. All the other instruments and sounds just play ""2nd fiddle"" to the singing voice.
Meanwhile, Speaker A sounds like the singer is standing as far away as the whole band, sometimes, with deeper voices, almost as he is standing slightly behind the other band members. Reminds me a bit sometimes of a concert where due to the acoustics of the venue or the mixing, the band sounds louder than the singers voice.

And this is where Im struggling. Neither sounds bad, does it ultimately just come down to which sound I prefer?

Is there a ""this is how it should sound and if it doesn't, then the speakers aren't good at their job?"".
Speaker B with it's higher treble just sounds clearer and crisper at first but it lacks in the other aspects. And I once read that the treble is the easiest for speakers to do well, even cheap ones will be good at that. 
Can I take that as an indication that Speaker A would ""win"" this comparison due to its performance in the other departments, aside from treble?"
audiophile,"Hello,

When we compare different editions of the same album, we regularly notice that the digital versions are impacted by the Loudness War, i.e. by the use of a Brickwall type limiter to increase the average sound level while reducing the peaks, or less cleanly with clipping. This is due to the fact that you can't go beyond 0 dB in digital!

Today, I propose to measure the impact of clipping and limiting and to compare this impact with what can be obtained with analog formats.

To measure this impact, we will use a reference signal at 1 kHz.

https://preview.redd.it/nk83umg7rnaa1.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7936e1005f089b8224c376747f0188324d66117e

The distortion will come from the DAC, from 0% to 0 dB. With the advantage that the digital copy does not introduce distortion!

To implement the clipping, we add 3 dB to the signal.

https://preview.redd.it/cb2yj95arnaa1.jpg?width=1036&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fbfd1e43aecb67e0d14595b3213ec418ff25ada

We then observe that the distortion is now present with a rate of more than 9% for an increase of 2 dB

https://preview.redd.it/d78e53xcrnaa1.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3d8149359a47d34c1fd9aad55c5930d3f59f35d

&amp;#x200B;

We test the limitation with a Brickwall limiter, we add 3 dB:

https://preview.redd.it/bymc2eohrnaa1.jpg?width=1408&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dc1082cebc64d81363b9d3c8fcb816e4a730fab

We then observe that the distortion is also present with a rate of more than 3% for an increase of 3 dB with the limiter, so less important than with clipping:

https://preview.redd.it/yctpuaqkrnaa1.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d0e4f5cf0f57d4f7e6ea27a06baeabc7f956ef8

It is interesting to compare these rates with analog sources like vinyl:

https://preview.redd.it/pe8xvgynrnaa1.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a98cd997b1d42755b9a296332bc667cf6720b70f

Distortion of more than 1 % at 0 dB

Or the cassette :

https://preview.redd.it/3nso06rprnaa1.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb274d04ff25bb1a5fb2c0b1227827620a9d242d

Distortion of 1.6% at 0 dB.

In conclusion, the digital is indeed very good in term of fidelity of the signal (I do not speak about listening) and superior to the analog formats, but, with only one condition, it is not to seek to have clipping or the limitation of dynamics of the war of the volume, in which case, the analog can have less distortion!

[New Hypex amps resting in their temporary spot](https://preview.redd.it/skjjggpcejaa1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9208fd048ef06538ac62ba508e2cf87e2cefdac1)

This past summer, I upgraded from a set of KEF LS50s to a set of Thiel CS2.3s. I remembered hearing Thiels first in the late 90s / early aughts and being absolutely enthralled at their sound. Of course they were driven by substantial stack of Mark Levinson gear in the demo room, and their sound always stuck with me.

So I jumped on a pair when some showed up nearby. When I got them home I hooked them up to my Schiit Vidar, I couldn't admit to myself that I was disappointed so I will say I was slightly taken aback at how close the sound was with the KEFs. There simply wasn't a huge difference, despite being towers tipping the scales at around 80 pounds a piece. There was a noticeable improvement in low level detail, but the bass was much more reserved (in retrospect, I'd even say 'shy') than I expected. I felt I had to keep my Paradigm sub in the loop - which I *absolutely* did not expect.

I knew these Thiels are hard to drive speakers - and after posting my impressions on here, everyone's responses verified my suspicions: the Vidar was simply not up to the task. 

So, what to do... 

I've been watching eBay, looking at the older Levinson, Krell, SimAudio and other gear come and go, pondering if that was the direction I wanted to take. I have also been thinking - hard - about possibly diving in to a Benchmark AHB2 amp. Reading over Benchmark's blog post about the myths (and truths) about amplifier output impedance and damping factor, I kept thinking...

I knew ASR loved the Hypex NCore amp platform. Their review of a DIY NC400 stereo amp was glowing - and when Amirm turned off one of the channels, it got even better. This review, combined with the breathtakingly low output impedance (suggesting good stability for difficulty loads) convinced me. So I pulled the trigger on a pair of NC400 monoblock kits from Madisound.

Building these was not at all difficult - each took a couple hours and was quite fun, to be honest. Cases were nice and solid, and instructions were... well... a bit shy on some detail (LMK if you'd like any tips on the build), but adequate.

&amp;#x200B;

[First build is almost complete](https://preview.redd.it/n9dkmlpgejaa1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bb52a7b3ea29bc7993a0f76b1270b0fbc97953e)

But how do they do with the Thiels - especially in comparison to the Schiit Vidar?

I had planned my inaugural tracks when I got them hooked up. Two words: jaw dropping.

&amp;#x200B;

First track: Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit - *Three Mile Island*

I knew this would be my first track. The distorted harmonica, guitars and great drum track at the onset I thought would really expose what I suspected was lacking with the Vidar. Man, I wasn't wrong. It was like the Thiels had been slouching like an emo tween at a family reunion, and all at once they absolutely SNAPPED to attention. I swear an octave was added to the bottom end, and the overall low end tightened up like it had just jumped in an ice covered lake on New Year's Day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second track: Dave Brubeck Quartet - *Take Five*

HUGE soundstage opened up. I raised an eyebrow in my sub's direction with the Isbell track, but now I'm staring directly at it... frowning. It's no longer adding anything here, but is muddying things up instead. Each time Joe Morello hits the bass drum, it feels like the Paradigm sub is mumbling over the top of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Third track: North Texas Wind Symphony ""Wind Dances"" - Joseph Schwantner, *In Evening's Stillness*

I have now disconnected the sub, and this is my acid test track. The loud sections of this piece make heavy use of a large symphonic bass drum and toms. They came through with texture, weight and impact unlike ever before. The brass, woodwinds, and melodic percussion instruments are all given their own space on stage. These Thiels are absolutely heart-stoppingly great speakers when fed a nutritious diet! 

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth track: Sarah Jarosz - *Build Me Up from Bones*

And there we have it. I have always been someone who tears up at live music, and this pushed me over the edge. Sarah's voice suspended over the subtlety of the difference between the flicked vs. plucked notes on the octave mandolin, the ghost ""scratched"" notes of the fiddle - finally giving way to the rise and fall of the supporting countermelody. This is EXACTLY why I love this hobby. 

&amp;#x200B;

So... Can a class-D amp be ""musical""? In my mind, musicality should not be up to the amp. The ideal amp should simply get out of the way of the artists and recording engineers - add nothing, subtract nothing, and should not have a ""sound"". These Hypex amps are the closest to that ideal I have heard in a looong time - I am *thrilled* at how they have transformed some tricky speakers and made them really sing. I can't imagine getting more bang for $1200 and a couple evening's worth of enjoyable assembly. Just crazy-banana-pants great.

Thanks for any and all advice."

Now my plan is to mainly listen to music through Tidal via a Chromecast which will be connected to my TV, giving me the album art etc. The issue is, the Rotel amp does not have a built in DAC. My question is, will the DAC built into the TV be comparable to a DAC that's in a similarly priced amp (Marantz 6007 for example)? If not, is there a decent DAC available for less than ¬£80?

How do I set these up to use the master output of my dj controller with my speakers and still have my speakers play through my audio interface from my computer? For some reason it‚Äôs not working and I have to choose my audio output as my dj controller. Plz help and will answer any questions if I have to.
audiophile,"... or is it snake oil? Living in  abig city where SW listening isn't possible due to all the QRM (radio frequency mayhem). I noticed my set-up sounded better after 0300 AM, even without drinking, LOL.

Noticed that more often and thinking about installing a cheap DC filter for my Marantz ND8006. My Quad 909 isn't bothered as it had a complete overhaul including caps in the power part to light up a house.

Your thought please. Thinking of buying a Audiolab DC block just for the ND8006 digital thing."
audiophile,"My set up is Apple TV -&gt; HDMI -&gt; Philips TV -&gt; optical -&gt; Yamaha AS501 DAC and amp

I might be being paranoid here but I don‚Äôt think music sounds that great when played from the Apple TV. Barely noticeable but it sounds better from my CD player, which should in theory sound the same I think.

Could my TV (a crap Philips that I bought for the stupid lights more than the TV itself) be messing with the sound somehow, even though in theory it‚Äôs a digital pass through?"
audiophile,Hey guys I got an bmw e36 that I want to upgrade the speakers on cause I listen to quite heavy bass rap related music such as Skrapz and Skepta etc so I was wondering if u guys could give me any help??
audiophile,"I will explain this as simply as I can, which shouldn't be hard because it seems to be a very simple process.

I have an old DVD sound system with speakers all around my room.  It is connected via AUX cord to my old gaming laptop, and I play Spotify through it.  Sounds great, super cheap, would recommend.

For Christmas, I received a JBL Clip.  I absolutely love it, it's awesome.

Now, what I'm wanting to do is play the same Spotify music through both my Clip and my laptop sound system at the same time - so that when I leave the room, the Clip continues playing the same song that is playing in my room, so that I'm not really disconnected from the music, if that makes sense.

I was thinking if I could find a music or audio sharing app, I could connect my laptop and my phone to the same room and have one (preferably the phone) control the music for both.

I was also considering maybe potentially finding some way to connect the Clip to the speaker set, but I can't imagine any way to do that as it's a very old stereo that has the wires that just slip into place - as far as I know, no way to connect a Bluetooth speaker, even with a modern converter.  

I am currently looking into if my laptop can output to both the AUX and the Clip at the same time, but it's not looking promising and honestly looks extremely complicated, if it works at all.

However I cannot for the life of me find ANYTHING that does this for me.  I've tried the Spotify friends website, I've tried screen sharing, discord, and a few apps that are supposed to connect to your Spotify so that you can play music with your friends.  (Spotify never showed up as an option when connecting music sources to them).

Does anyone know of a simple way to do this?  Surely I'm not the only person who's had this issue before."
audiophile,"Hi all!

Firstly apologies in advance for any technical grammar errors. Very new to this space and learning by the day!

I'm looking to get started in the hifi space, initially just with headphones (so not too concerned about speakers at the moment due to my apartment situation but will likely add these to the setup within 12 months). 

I headed down to my local hifi shop yesterday to discuss getting started. The employee I spoke with recommended that I get started with an amp and headphones. He booked me in for a session next week to test some different products out.

I enquired about the suggested cost split between the amp and headphones as I'm unsure which one I should prioritise cost wise and by how much (e.g. should I be spending twice as much on my amp than my headphones or vice versa). The employee said that his colleague knows far more about headphones than him so he'll chat about that with me next week, but he said it's also worth getting a second opinion (hence my post).

And so I ask, how much should I be relatively spending on an amp and a pair of headphones? Is there anything else I need too? I'm thinking of starting off with a budget of around ¬£1000 give or take 20% (although I've read enough Reddit posts to know how much of a potential rabbit hole this is going to be).

Thanks in advance!"
audiophile,"Started my audio gear journey middle of 2021 and its been a blast so far. I work from home and as you can see the room isn't the biggest.

The turntable is probably my pride and joy, it's a Pro-Ject X1 that I got used for ¬£450 off Ebay, its fitted with an Ortofon OM20 cartridge. The receiver is a Denon X2700h that I got for cheap ¬£350. The headphones are Sennheiser Hd600 that I use on my loxjie p20 tube amp.

audiophile,Right now I‚Äôm using a pair of Kanto YU4 speakers setup with my Pro-Ject Carbon Evo TT. I‚Äôm considering switching to a different setup with a Cambridge AXA35 integrated amp and some Klipsch RP-400M speakers. Any thoughts on the YU4 vs. AXA35/RP-400M setup? If the YU4s are going to be close to the same sound then I might as well just keep it simple and not mess with the separate amp and speakers. This is a strictly music setup that I‚Äôll be using for vinyl and for streaming.
audiophile,"Hi everyone do you guys know a small good speaker that can fit there ?

audiophile,"Recently I was in the market for getting a pair of new speakers, and in my place cantons are currently having good prices especially with their reference K Series. Without researching much, I went to the hifi store and gave a listen to their Reference 5K Vs  some similar priced ones from brands like Bowers &amp; Wilkins, Focal, Sonus Faber, KEF, ELAC, Spendor, Harbeth, PMC, Audio Physic and Dynaudio. In terms of bass extension in the room, and midrange transparency Cantons clearly was much better and tonally neutral in mids and highs. 
Also, soundstage was totally huge with nice 3D placement. 

So, at this point, before jumping in I wanted to see what others say about this speaker as this was already on the expensive side.


Unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt see much about this speaker other than magazine reviews.
Then I came across a thread in audiosciencereview, where they speak about 7K not 5K and I saw two guys arguing that it has a heavy distortion for the price. A quick google search gave me the answer that this is not in audible range. But then I thought, what if if someone who has no clue google about them and end up not choosing it? 

The blow up on a non issue here is too much to level that they are clearly intending to promote another brand exagerrating it.

Sometimes ASR guys are crossing the limits right ?

audiophile,"I've got 2x Bose 301 Series 2 and 2x Bose 301 Series 4 and I've attached them to my old Luxman LV-103 amplifier with a bluetooth adapter attached to it, and everything worked out perfectly and the sound is amazing. 

The issue I have is with the placement of the speakers. The manuals only provide the placement information for a pair of these beauties and I couldn't find any information on how I should place 4x of them. Should I place the ""Right"" speaker on left while putting them on the back? Since they're reflecting speakers I thought that would make sense so that they have a surface to reflect the sound on. Or should I just ditch 2 of them and use only 2? 

Thanks a lot!"
audiophile,"Anyone using this amp? What speakers are best for it,"

The grounding cable is properly secured and I have tried different cables/ plugs and nothing seems to resolve the 120Hz buzz!!!

audiophile,"They are really really old, tried searching online for Tecnik Acoustics and to no avail.

I used to sit at the bed when I was a kid watching movies on the TV and the speaker sounded nice to me at that time ( all I can remembered was it was bassy, sounds wide but not very detailed ), it can't be powered on anymore sadly.

Sorry for the bad pictures and little details on the speakers, wish I can remember more but I didn't really care much about the sound quality back then."

I've been looking into some external audio amp/dacs but their are just so many to choose from that I'm kind of stuck. I know these can get very expensive but for now I'm looking at more of a budget option. I would like something between $50-100.

It's an old system where the satellite speakers connect to the subwoofer, and the subwoofer has a single 3.5 mm port.

audiophile,"I tried to record it , but it seems no difference. But in real life , its kinda frustrating! What could be the reason?"
audiophile," 

Hello Audiophiles, I recently moved into an apartment with a living room space of 4.6m by 3.8m and looking to purchase a good speaker amp combo within the place. I got the opportunity to demo the Polk R200 and R600 speakers with Yamaha and Rotel amplifiers. Unfortunately the R700's were sold out and on backorder at the time. Personally, I enjoy a lot of bass but I also want to be mindful of my neighbours. The R200 and R600 sound almost identical with the R600 providing a little bit more oomph in the bass which I preferred. However, even with that little more oomph the bass was not up to my expectations, as I have been currently spoiled with a SVS sb1000 pro nearfield. The difference between the amplifiers were also negligible with the Rotel sounding just a tad bit warmer and pleasing to my ear.

With the given information above, what recommendations and speakers compositions would you guys recommend me? Should I try go for the R700 despite the small room, or do you think the subwoofer route would be an option in an apartment setting?"

audiophile,"Hi everyone!
The official definition of an audiophile, as per Wikipedia, goes as:

An audiophile is a person who is enthusiastic about high-fidelity sound reproduction. An audiophile seeks to reproduce the sound of a piece of recorded music or a live musical performance, typically inside closed headphones, In-ear monitors, open headphones in a quiet listening space, or a room with good acoustics.


Let‚Äôs define High-Fidelity while where at it ( Merriam-Webster definition):

the reproduction of an effect (such as sound or an image) that is very faithful to the original.


So in theory,  I am sure we could agree that an audiophile is someone who seeks faithful acoustic reproduction of music.

But variety is the spice of life!
Let‚Äôs share our personal views and opinions of what makes someone an audiophile, what is all about for you?"
audiophile,Does anyone know what studio monitors would sound better then minirigs for around the same price. I‚Äôm open to more suggestions then just studio monitors also.
audiophile,"I started playing with Fletcher-Munson/ISO 226 equal loudness correction on my setup about a year ago. I listen at about 60 dB most of the time and rarely listen above 70 dB, so the bass on my studio monitors is somewhat anemic at those levels. Rather than just boost the bass haphazardly I decided to look into what to do besides adding a sub and that's when I discovered the magical science and history of trying to correct the phenomenon I was experiencing.

When searching for a solution the first option I tried for a while was Equalizer APO's Loudness Correction Filter by Alexander Walch. It was an ""OK"" solution and finally brought the bass alive on my PreSonus Eris E8's. After tuning it for a while it was nice to hear what music should supposedly sound like at my relatively low listening levels. After a while I got tired of the quirks of Equalizer APO, how it played with Windows 11 on the backend, how I had to constantly reinstall the APO's after Windows updates, how I would never know if it's actually turned on, the questionable nature of if it was screwing up my audio quality or Windows audio stack, etc, so I looked for another solution.

After weeks of searching and testing I found a perfect solution: [EKIO](http://www.lupisoft.com/ekio/). But I needed to reverse engineer Alexandar Walch's correction curve. That actually wasn't too hard after looking at his [source code](https://sourceforge.net/p/equalizerapo/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/filters/loudnessCorrection/LoudnessCorrectionFilter.cpp) for a few days.

[This is what my curve ended up looking like using the two parametric EQ points and values that Alexander Walch used in his source code and deciding on a static delta amount of dB to correct for.](https://preview.redd.it/2285emycebaa1.png?width=1922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe4791d23b211ccb3bd39db12c6bb9f23835b13a)

After using this curve for a long time and revisiting the FM/ISO 226 documentation several times I questioned the accuracy of his curve. It turns out, so did others on the forums. So I looked for a better curve to shoot for. After weeks of research the rabbit hole led to me to about 3 sources of information that I combined into my best attempt:

[This amazing thread on Audio Science Review](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/should-you-use-fletcher-munson-loudness-compensation.29543/page-9)  
[This Excel to calculate a curve based on normalization and your chosen delta](https://www.merlijnvanveen.nl/en/calculators/59-equal-loudness)  
[This example of a 3 point parametric EQ](https://andrewhunt.com.au/equal-loudness/)

I combined the info from the last link above with slightly tweaked values to end up with this more aggressive, but hopefully more accurate curve than my old one:

[New 3 point curve](https://preview.redd.it/1hoawz7pfbaa1.png?width=1922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0682963d4e97c75e493e2e1a15ae446d6d5a7df1)

It sounds better than my old curve. Is it more correct? Hard to say. It sounds ""warmer"" if that makes sense. As it should given the shape of the new curve.

My problem is, I can't decide if I did it right. It's really hard to match the curves I see when I'm just blindly tweaking the parametric EQ values in EKIO and I can't find a filter calculator/builder that will do this automatically. I realize it's impossible to get the infinite upward sweep on both sides with a parametric bell or shelf filter, but since it rolls of at infrasonic and supersonic frequencies I figure it doesn't matter anyway.

I think I'm shooting for something like the green 60 phon curve on this chart, normalized to 80 phon (which is a compromise of all given opinions of should you be shooting for 85 dB, 79 dB, sometimes 90 dB?)

[My target](https://preview.redd.it/6c6lpjvpgbaa1.png?width=1391&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b8ef1ae0731dffad01d26346b7bfcc12ce1164f)

I have about 900 other thoughts on the matter as well, but I've hit analysis paralysis and information overload in my brain. I'm basically just asking if my new curve is as good as it can get, or did I set up my PEQ's wrong? I realized after reading the [Audio Science Review thread](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/should-you-use-fletcher-munson-loudness-compensation.29543/) that some of this is subjective and people have blended art with science to get a good compromise. Should I just give up?"

audiophile,"I bought a set of powered speakers about a month ago from Best Buy, last pair in stock at the time, locally they haven't gotten anymore back in stock either - and I really don't want to box them back up and exchange them for this issue. 

When I took them out of the box I noticed a have a rather obvious hole in the grille. The cloth is grey, the frame is black...so it's pretty obvious.

I reached out to the warranty department on December 19th. They replied within a day asking for pictures of the damage, serial number and proof of purchase. I sent it all to them on the 21st and then...radio silence. 

I called them yesterday and left a voicemail after sitting listening to hold music for like 10 minutes. I tried reaching out to their twitter today with no reply yet. 

The speakers are usable, but the grille is unsightly and since I'm a bit OCD about it I just...literally catch myself staring at it sometimes since it's right on my desk within 2 feet of me. I would take the grilles off but I do have pets and dust is pretty bad where I am so I'd rather not. 

Has anyone dealt with their warranty department before? Did it really take that long for them to respond to you about any claims? 

I'm starting to want to just say to hell with it and boxing them back up and taking them back to Best Buy for credit and maybe jumping up to the next version of them."

audiophile,"Hey, so I ordered banana plugs as I wanted a more secure connection.

I have monitor audio bronze 2 speakers and was told banana plugs would fit.

I opened the package and they're seemingly too big to even fit.

Is there something I'm missing here? Do banana plugs come in different sizes? I feel incredibly dumb right now. Lol

audiophile,"Bought my wife a 200 CD changer for her 40 something birthday. Connecting it to the sound bar has been a challenge, but after significant testing, it appears the sound bar audio processing unit can‚Äôt handle the signal from the changer.

Throughout the troubleshooting process she heard the music played via optical, hdmi, mono rca, 3.5mm‚Ä¶ routed thru the tv and so on. 

The last step in my troubleshooting process included my swan speakers in my office, to which she said I want that in the living room.

I listen to Tidel Hifi with exclusive mode enabled and MQA pass through turned on, so the DAC is handling volume and MQA encoding.

It's almost as if there is too much stereo separation and I swear the left channel is slightly louder than the right channel- so much that I set my D90SE to have +2.5db on the right channel.

audiophile,"Has anyone here used the CXN's built-in pre-amp?

This way I could use the CXN as a pre-amp in one input, but still use the other inputs as integrated inputs for my CD player, turntable, etc.

I mentioned this idea to a guy in a hifi shop and he looked at me like I had two heads. Is the CXN pre-amp no good? It would be an extremely convenient solution for not just myself, but also for my girlfriend, who is patient enough with all the noise-making rectangle shaped boxes that have invaded our living room over the years, and shouldn't have to flip a bunch of switches or get discouraged from listening to music because it can be, to non-gear freaks, intimidating (or just plain irritating)

The building was new. Why can‚Äôt they invest in a concrete wall with holes for speakers. There was a library behind the stage. For the party: close the library and use it as box for the speaker.

I have this setup at 4 different places (with different receivers, subs, speakers, but the setup is the same and also none of the receivers have built in filters), so I'm looking for a solution that could be applied to all of them.

I'm trying to use a high pass filter to protect the speakers, make them blend better with the sub, have less distortion at higher volumes, etc.

The thing is, none of the stereo receivers have high pass filters for their speaker output. I can set a 12db/oct low pass filter on the active sub itself though.

I was thinking I could just build passive high pass filters and put them between the speakers and the receiver, but I're read something about how that interferes with the speaker's internal crossover (it increases the low pass filter frequency for the midrange speaker, effectively making it a bandpass filter, or whatever), which should be avoided. Is this something I should worry about?

I don't think there are active high level filters?

Is there a better way without losing functionality and spending a lot of money on changing core elements of the setup?

I really wish to keep the receivers as they weren't cheap and their functions are used a lot (spotify, airplay)."

The two turntables I've seen highly recommended were the Fluance RT81/RT82 and the Pro-ject debut carbon. Then I need a pre-amp and an amp if I get passive speakers correct? And possibly a DAC. This is where I'm stuck.

I want to make sure I purchase the right pre amp and amp to allow for versatility in the input. Record player, TV and streaming if possible. At what stage do I input that? The pre amp, amp, or do I have to purchase a DAC?

I want to avoid extra cost while allowing for maximum versatility and quality within the ~800$ budget.

Thanks and sorry if I'm just confused there are a lot of options and terminology to learn :)"

audiophile,"i‚Äôm looking for a pretty high end microphone for when i‚Äôm on virtual calls with potential clients.
believe it or not, in the industry i‚Äôm in things like that go a long way.
budget is around ¬£500 for mic itself. (i understand some mics require things like a cloud lifter etc so i‚Äôm not including that in the budget and will keep that as seperate) 
my #1 biggest thing is that the mic CANNOT be shown on screen, therefore needs to be able to pick up really clean audio from either on the desk, or out of frame above monitor or something. 

yes i know, this probably sounds obscene, but this is what i require.

shure sm7b sounds great, but needs to be close to ur mouth to sound good (from what i‚Äôve seen) 
sooo is there a good xlr mic that will be able to pick up hi def audio on a mount that can sit far enough off screen (probably about 30-50cm from face) 
or will need to buy a shotgun mic? and if so which one
thanks!"
audiophile,"Hi all, I am in the market for some stands for a pair of Wharfedale Diamond 12.2 speakers. Their footprint is about 8x11. I am curious about what top plate is best and overall quality, stability, etc. I am considering one of the following stands. The Pangea has a top plate of 6x9 (additional 30 dollar purchase) and the Kanto comes with a 7x7 top plate. Does anyone have any experience or insight on these two?

audiophile,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm on my way to assemble my first ever sound system, but I‚Äôm very confused as the market has a lot to offer, and I‚Äôm not so good at understanding the specifics of the equipment.
I plan to buy an LP player Rega Planar 3, as I‚Äôm a huge fan of LP records, plus a PSU Rega.
The problem lies in the choice of speakers and an amplifier.

My living room is 23 sqm (247 ft2). I‚Äôm looking for something that will not overwhelm the room. 
I have already heard Dali Rubicon 6 in a store and absolutely loved it, but I haven‚Äôt heard Matin Logan 60XTi yet because in order to listen to it, I have to go to another city. It is not a problem for me to go there, but I was wondering if it is worth going there to listen to the speakers. Does anyone have any experience with these two models? And what are your preferences?

I was also wondering about the amplifier. In a store I was recommended an integrated amplifier NAD C399 with a bluesound power in it as I plan to connect the speakers sometimes to my TV for streaming music. Is it any good or there are better options for this price?

TLDR: I love Dali Rubicon 6, but heard that Martin Logan 60XTi is also good. Plan to use with Rega Planar 3. With a 23sqm (247ft2) room don‚Äôt know which one would go better and what amplifier matches with them."

My speakers (logitech z533) are making hissing noises - even at minimum volume i can hear hissing (when i go to sleep i just unplug them from power). Not to mention higher volumes‚Ä¶

My speakers are connected to my pc via aux. when i also connect them to my mac the noise is unbearable (hissing, digital noise).

I tried different cables but no.
I also bought a dac amp (fiio e10k) which in theory should output cleaner sound (mac ‚Äî&gt; fiio ‚Äî&gt; speakers) but no difference (idk if theres a dac inside the logi, i figured the fiio should do a better job).

Just unboxed my stereo system which were packed up 10 years ago. It has the following components:

* Meridian 568 digital processor

audiophile,"Hi!

I own a Clarett+ 4Pre interface but lately I was eyeing with DAC/Amp bundles to have more home entertainment listening rather than music production (what I normally do). Plus also listening to LP‚Äôs thus I need a phono amp too.

I settled with iFi and want to use with my Beyerdynamic headphones mainly: DT990Pro-250Ohm and DT700ProX-48Ohm. Also my 1st IEM: Letshuoer S12 Pro.

The iFi Zen Dac V2 + Zen Can + Zen Phono seems like an affordable good choice.

However, there are three iFi Zen Signature items supposed to be higher quality regarding hardware components especially tailored to Sennheiser 6XX, to Hifiman HFM and one model to Meze MZ99.

There is a switch where this special EQ could be turned off making them suitable for any headphones and IEM‚Äôs, they say.

My questions are:
1. Do any of you know which Amp would be suitable for my headphones listed above?
2. Do the Signature AMP model really worth the extra?
3. Perhaps the regular line would be fine (maybe with the ZenDac signature only, that‚Äôs not specific).

As you see I‚Äôm beginner still but if Signature DAC/Amp are really that better, I‚Äôm down for it."

audiophile,"Please bear with me here, I know this may seem kind of ridiculous but I didn't know where else to post this. 

So I downloaded a soundtrack album for the movie The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) at 320 kbps MP3. At first it was really good, but the problem with it was that it took way too much space on my computer for one album than I'd like (like 500-600 MB) and I don't have a lot of space on my computer. (Basically I'm prioritizing space over quality here). 

I figured I'd get a lower bitrate for more space bc I'm not exactly an expert on audio and won't care about the little details, so I found and downloaded one at 160 kbps which takes like 170 MB.

The thing is, I noticed a difference in the sampling rate of the albums - the 320 kbps one is at 44.1 kHz, and the 160 kbps one was at 48 kHz.

Pretty much all the music in my iTunes library is in 44.1 kHz, so I'm a bit confused and worried. Does it make a difference? Which should I go with? Someone please advise me on this, I'm not an expert at audio and music files.

I listen to music on a pair of Beats Solo 3 headphones if anyone wants to know that as well."

[image of mic, keyboard and mouse to the left any suggestions regarding mic or stand placement more than welcome aswell ](https://preview.redd.it/dv9mc2ne9v9a1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b916e84d559d84fb6d66a6feec16a45c61162f91)

 

Ok so I purchased the Wave 3 specifically to use with discord, I had alot of issues but after playing around with the settings in discord and wavelink I think its pretty good now.

Only issues now are that ive purchased a third party foam windscreen and the elgato wave pop filter, the reason why is because I wanted to just in general improve sound quality and also hopefully eliminate the sound of my keyboard, I just ordered them aswell. Is there anything else other than attaching these 2 things I could do to aid in these 2 areas? I also don't have a desk mic stand, should I grab one of those and how should I position the mic to best pick up my voice and my voice only. I also have a ceiling fan on in my room that basically has to be on 24/7 so I dont perish of heat stroke so if there's a way to prevent that from being picked up any suggestions regarding that would be good aswell.

Also here are all of my settings in case you guys have any suggestions regarding that:

Discord Settings:

Auto determine input sensitivity: On

Advanced Voice Activity: On

Noise Suppression: Off

Echo Cancellation: Off

Auto Gain Control: Off

Wave Link Settings:

Input Gain: 20Db

Enhanced Lowcut Filter: On

Clipguard: On

Wave Gain Lock: On

Windows Settings:

Mic Volume: 100

Disable All Enhancements: On

24 Bit 48000Khz: On

&amp;#x200B;

On the elgato subreddit it was suggested to me that I download a NVidia broad cast plugin and adjust background noise reduction through that and that has helped massively aswell but any further suggestions from you guys would be great aswell.

I've read that the depth and imaging within is very dependant on timings, which makes sense.

Has anyone had any positive, tangible difference with Dirac with anything else besides the low end?

My room is treated semi-well (still in the process of getting bass-traps and some hybrid panels to replace some of my regular absorbtion-panels), speakers set up differently again just today (identically on both sides, equilateral triangle blah blah blah), for the first time using the Sumiko Master set-up-method which did improve a couple of things, but no holographic stage yet at least.

audiophile,"
Outputs tons of heat from the actual amp/dac in addition to the heat from the power supply. Makes one not want to stack them and it's hard enough to stack them due to retaining extra heat.  with the RCA positioning anyhow

DAC has no power button, I literally have to unplug this thing to turn it off and keep it from wasting money and dumping heat. No auto off feature on either. What a waste of a few simple things JDS labs could have done to make these not a 90's level wasteful tech.

DAC power on light area can be moved simply by pushing on it. Cheap, but the most minor flaw.

audiophile," Hi! I just bought a new stereo system for my room and would like to connect my 27"" iMac to the receiver (Marantz NR1200). I'm wondering what the best option would be for highest audio quality? From what I understand, the headphones jack for newer mac does not have optical out as the previous iMacs used to. It also lacks an HDMI port. I do own an USB to HDMI adapter, but not sure if that's going to result in a loss of sound quality? Or if it might be an issue when using HDMI for audio only? Would lightning port to USB maybe be the best option? Looks like the receiver has front panel USB port, if that works? I am new to all this, so sorry if any of these questions seem dumb. I'm sure there are probably several ways to make this work, but was hoping to connect it in a way that provides the best sound experience. Thanks in advance for your help : )"

audiophile,"So I'm kind of in a weird position. I live in a small bedroom (fig. 1) and I recently saved up enough for the Marantz PM-6007, Kef LS50 Metas and the Pro-ject Debut Carbon Evo. I also want to connect my TV (Samsung UE40KU6172U) to the amp so I can use the speakers for gaming/watching movies. But I don't know where to place the Pro-ject so it doesn't interfere with the speaker vibrations. 

I want to place them on the desk (fig. 2) so I can have easy access to the turntable and the amp, but I'm wondering if there is certain stands that can be stuck to the table or wall for the speakers not to be on the same surface as the turntable? 

Otherwise, I'll have put them underneath the desk (fig. 3) on a AV rack, which won't be optimal, since I won't have space underneath for my legs when I sit, and I won't be able to change the record so quickly without groaning about my back (I'm 6'7).

audiophile,"With stereo amps, does jumping up tiers produce better sound?  Or is it purely about the added features and power?

Take the below 3 units that are often recommended and get great reviews. The Sony and the NAD are both fairly basic integrated amps.  The Sony has more power and features (Bluetooth, tuner) than the NAD, yet the NAD costs 150% more.  Why then would someone bother looking at the NAD?  Same question with the Audiolab.  Would going with the 6000A produce better sound than either the Sony or NAD paired with a DAC like the Schiit Modi+ ($129) or Modi Multibit ($299)?

audiophile,"Hey, 

just as title, is there any in depth research done on it ?  
or experience on it ?

As receivers update the price point for any receiver with pre-out increases, which is oddly enough because they have more powerful amplifiers.. which I really do not need as I have power amps for each channel.

So, my thoughts: if I take my speakers, plug in and scope it to see voltage of lets say 100V, then I just make a voltage divider to turn 100V to 2V so I get a 0-2V line RCA for my power amps ?

how is the quality, there is only resistive load with the adapters, I've never used them but considering now as I look at receivers to get a hdmi, room correction and rca outs for my power amps...

audiophile,"Bottom line up front: forgive my ignorance as I am brand new to this community and realize I have a tremendous amount to learn still, but I have to begin somewhere so here we go.

I recently got my first true HiFi system setup after messing around in the world of headphones for a few years. Have had this setup for a few days now. Current set up is as follows:

KEF R3 speakers
Speedwoofer Mk II subwoofer
Topping DX5 DAC- used purely in DAC mode
Schiit Freya + Pre Amplifier
Schiit Vidar 2 Amplifier

Source is Tidal (exclusive mode with MQA pass through) through PC USB into DX5 and Optical from LG C2 into DX5 for streaming movies/TV.

Connections:
XLR from DX5 to Freya + 
RCA from Freya + to Vidar 2
RCA from Freya + to Speedwoofer Mk II

Music was the primary point of consideration when setting up the system, but also hoped for great sound for casual movie viewing.

So the issue that I am having, or that I feel that I am having, is that the volume control just seems ‚Äúoff‚Äù to me. Sound is almost completely inaudible to me until I pass the 12 o‚Äôclock mark on the Freya volume dial and really doesn‚Äôt come alive until around the 3-5 o‚Äôclock mark. I just feel like it shouldn‚Äôt have to be this high for a reasonable listening volume. Granted I do like my music loud, but I‚Äôve been measuring with an iPhone app decibel meter and still only getting to around 80db at about 3 meters without maxing out the volume dial. Is this reasonably expected volume performance or is there potentially a device not performing properly? Do I need to just buy a second Vidar to run in mono? Or could it potentially be an issue with DAC output?

Side note- the performance and volume output when using the optical output from my TV is roughly half that, although I do understand there is an issue with ESS DACs and the poor signal TVs are outputting via optical, I can get at best 80 db in tube mode and the volume dial maxed when watching movies. Looking into solutions to clean up the optical signal as well without having to get an AVR.

TLDR: I expected to have my face melted off with volume especially in a mid-near field set-up. Face has yet to be melted off."

audiophile,"Finally giving LS60 and subs a proper tryout, only complicated by the mildest of hangovers. 

I love the boxes these come in.  Never had an easier removal process. Setup is relatively easy and finding a sweet spot unchallenging.   

For comparison these are in the same room as a pair of Zu Druid Mk V and a matching Zu sub. Powered by a Devialet Expert Pro 1000 (a dual mono super integrated).  Mostly fed from a Roon Nucleus and sometimes a Luxman PD444 turntable with a nice Dynaco cartridge. 

By comparison the LS60 are definitely a sideways step.  Not as revealing in the top end or as deep in the bottom. Sounds like piano foot pedals are harder to discern in the KEF.  So detail retrieval is perhaps not as excellent.

But soundstage and vocals are top notch.  Definitely exhibit the KEF sound and that luscious middle.  They will make a lovely addition in another room but I don‚Äôt think they can replace my Zu setup for primary music listening.  A shame as I was really hoping to reduce and simplify. 

On the future-proof front.  These are not. Assuming the electronics last decades, I doubt the app will.  When that does so does sub configuration, EQ adjustment, internet radio, left-right primary swapping, etc.  Hopefully KEF will be smart when the time comes and open source the interfaces.

Even if repaired, I wouldn‚Äôt use it as I don‚Äôt have a dedicated listening space anymore. And I wouldn‚Äôt trust it even if I did.

It pains me to consider scrapping something like this, but I‚Äôll do it if it makes sense. I gotta think the power supplies and such are worth something!

Is it worth selling in its present state?

audiophile,"Hi audiophile specialist ,

first of all I am new to the audiophile world, so sorry for any redundant questions.

I am using a DAC (connected with USB to my PC) with an implemented AMP for my headphones while listening some nice .FLAC files. Recently I am back to use CDs for a easy listening session and I am really enjoying it (and yes I know I can rip them all as lossless .FLAC files, but I enjoy the part where I select the CD from my shelf and put them in the cd drive :) ). With the external USB DVD/blu ray drive connected to my laptop/PC I am able to use an EQ software and I do not need to buy any extra hardware (like the Schiit Lokius or something else).

So my question is: Are there any audio quality differences if I use an external USB DVD/blu ray drive as a CD transport in comparison to any professional dedicated CD transport player (e.g.  Audiolab 6000)?

Thank you in advance for any help."

audiophile,"Greets all,

I recently collected a second-hand Parasound A21+. I've noticed that the right side heat sinks are warmer than the left side, somewhere in the 10-15 degree (F) range. I've been driving a new pair of KEF LS50 Metas for the last 6 weeks or so with it (on the slow prowl for some floor standing speakers too). The difference was first noticed when touching the amp with my bare hands, and then verified with an infrared thermometer.

I'm not familiar with where the specific heat generating internal components are arranged inside the device. I was merely wondering if this is a relatively normal characteristic of the device or if it warrants keeping an eye on or further investigation. 

The amp is getting inputs from a new Halo P6. There is more than adequate clearance around the amp, at least 8 or more inches on every side, except the bottom. The amp is not stacked on anything, nor is there anything on top of the amp.

Thanks everyone!"

audiophile,"With every little upgrade (or big one) the benefit of hearing more detail, clarity, depth, soundstage... it's like an addiction to see when the return on investment is no longer worth the work, research and expense. 

Better dac? Okay, but I heard the one bit into the Lumin2 was plenty. Worth going to a Holo... but the May KTE? Okay but now the interconnects are out of scope. 

The time finally came that short of buying another house with balanced walls I was fine with the sound. Still, it tugged at me, all the comments re room treatment from friends and /r/audiophile that I talked at length with GIK who said that polyfusers for dipole speakers was key to being a bit of an even playing ground to our asymmetrical music loft. And they were right, with those and a pair of bass traps (and some huge panels in the ML CLX Art speakers) is pure magic when you choose your eyes. 

Okay mods, was that 70 words? :)

‚Äî‚Äî

Hi all, I‚Äôve browsed here for a long time and appreciate many of the opinions shared here. 

I have been into this hobby for quite a while and have a number of purchases over the years from Audiogon and such places. 

Current main components are:
- Thiel cs3.7 fronts
- Dual son of Ampzilla II monoblocks
- Bryston 9bsst for surrounds (home theater)
- Marantz av7704 pre (not the best audio, but excellent features, once again some HT needs)
- SVS dual sb16 subs
- Torus power conditioner

I read quite a few reviews across the internet on components and always wondering if the grass is greener on the other side. I know they are nice components, well regarded, but also about a decade old for much of the stuff. 

Any thoughts on whether spending more or specifics that should be changed that make sense?"

audiophile,"Hi everyone. This is my first post here, so I hope I'm in the right place!

Here's the deal; I bought an Audio Technica LP120, and my Edifier R1280DBs (although surprisingly good for the price) don't deliver on sound. I don't know if it's user error, but you can only adjust the bass and treble, and there isn't a way to adjust the midrange tones at all. Plus, I am constantly tweaking those two adjustments depending on the record. That can't be right?

I know the deck is very capable, but I have no idea how to create a speaker setup that will do it justice.

I have an existing studio monitor and audio interface setup (2 x 45W Yamaha HS8 monitors and a Presonus Audiobox 96), which were awesome when I was writing and composing but have been told the two can't co-exist. Given the fact that I've had other advice to ignore the built-in preamp and go for an external amp/receiver setup to get the most out of the deck, I'm now completely confuddled.

Is there anyone out there who might know what I'm trying to do here and give me some pointers?

Is it true that I can't connect the deck to my audio interface and take advantage of these monitor speakers? It seems such a waste, and I don't want to shell out for another pair of speakers if it doesn't work. My house, cabin and garage are already full! So, if it REALLY doesn't work, what's the alternative? Upgrade my Edifiers to something with more adjustment capability OR switch from preamp to external amp/receiver (if so, where do I start)?

I'd appreciate any pointers from you, lovely people!"

I presently use two Adam F7 nearfield studio monitors connected to my high end gamign PC (which surprisingly works well with them connected to my Asus motherboard).

The 2 issues are that:

1 - They are nearfield monitors and I use them mostly to put music in the whole room to dance with my partner, rather than listen from the ideal position for that type of monitors.

2- I dont produce music with then and would appreciate some more full subbass since I listen to a lot of Techno, drum and bass and Dub music.

I am wondering if I shouls add a subwoofer to my setup, or get read of the producer-oriented nearfield monitors and start from the beginning with loudspeakers. Would consumer oriented loudspeakers make that much of a difference in terms of filling the room? (Room is wode but only 3 meters deep) Could loudspeakers be bassy enough to not need a sub? Is there a possibility to get good consumer oriented setups that are active? I kind of hate the idea of having to shop for dac / amp when my computer works pretty well for that already."

audiophile,"Desperately need an ear pad replacement on these, has anyone found a good replacement for the pads on these headphones?"
audiophile,"Hi everyone, 

there have been a couple of threads on this topic already, but I'm still a bit unsure about using the phase shift in a subwoofer correctly in this case. 

I have a very simple desktop PC setup with two [M-Audio BX5 D3](https://m-audio.com/bx5d3) speakers. I use them mostly to play music and software guitar/bass sims. For a while, I felt that they were lacking low-end frequencies, which I was barely able to make out, but not really hear well.

That's why I decided to try adding a [Presonus Eris Sub 8](https://www.presonus.com/products/Eris-Sub8) to the setup. 

So far, I'm pretty happy with this setup, they're not the most deluxe products, but the sub gets the job done of filling out the previously missing lower frequencies.

However, I'm a bit confused about the sub's phase shift setting, which works on a 0/180¬∞ base. 

I originally left it set to the default 0¬∞ and that sounded fine, but I just tried to reverse it and I have the impression that the overall sound is *much* clearer, even to the extent that I noticed some background sounds in music that I hadn't heard as well or at all before. This was very weird to me, as it should have been only in the stereo monitors' frequency range and not in the sub's. 180¬∞ also seems to reduce the lower-mid ""rumble"" that I hear by a lot. 

Using the phase shift also allows me to lower the sub's volume to around .5/10 instead of 1-1.5, because it seems to make the bass cut through a lot more. So generally, also by the manual, this should be the best setting ""at which is bass is the loundest"", I suppose. 

However, I was under the impression that a phase shift would cause cancellation of certain frequencies, at least that's how I thought active noise cancelling works - by playing unwanted noise phase-shifted. 

I also used a few of the online frequency hearing tests to check the sub's frequency range and even with the low-pass filter set to 80 Hz, it still is audible way above 200 Hz with a very wide roll-off. 

I'm a bit paranoid that what I'm hearing now is just some kind of low-mid scoop by the phase shifted sub, which makes the bass sound punchy, but I'm actually missing some frequencies which get cancelled out. 

Is this usage legitimate or should you rather leave it at 0¬∞, turn it back up and play around with an EQ to get the desired effect?"

I found a seller online selling japanese Bluray Audio disc, like the one on the picture. It seems like they are compatible with all bluray players and they offer 192kHz/24 bit resolution. They seem to be quite expensive so I'm wondering how they compare to for example hires streaming from Qobuz and Tidal. Qobuz for example, offers Coltrane's Blue Train in 192kHz/24bit. Would a Bluray disc sound better? Just a bit curious since I have never really seen or let alone heard a Bluray audio disc before."

audiophile,"I'm a very sensitive person and usual listen to things at low volumes, infact the lower the volume, providing there's full clarity, the better for me. I've noticed my laptop speakers aren't very clear with dialogue at low volumes and my stereo speaker setup has too much middle/lower frequencies that make hummy/muddy/slightly boomy sounds which isn't ideal at night when all I want is the sound not the noise (sound being, i can hear it, noise being, it just emits noise aimlessly with low fidelity). I've always heard krk2's are good, would they suffice for my use case or am I looking for something else?

I don't know a lot about speakers beyond imedance, amps, and frequencies. I know where the frequencies I like are for my listening case but I don't have much eq choice on my current amp. I don't know if there's a budget amp with a fairly full and accurate eq setting? Lots of sliders perhaps? I've used equalizer apo before and play music files with foobar2000 but I'd rather have a physical eq that I can touch rather than - open software, click click click click drag click click drag etc

As a *rough* budget, ¬£/$100 max for speakers and ¬£/$50 for amp. Absolute max for the best of the best for what I want would be ¬£/$200 all in

audiophile,"What are the sound quality considerations of using different types and implementations of EQ?

This comes from my noticing something concerning about Equalizer APO. When I use parametric filters I perceive a loss of resolution or air. 

I tested this with a peaking filter at 100 Hz, -0.1 dB, Q 0.7. Easy looking little filter that should have absolutely no audible effect whatsoever. Yet when I tested myself blindly, I could tell when the filter was on. Every time. 

What is going on here? Is EAPO not good? Are these types of filters inherently going to always and significantly degrade the sound? Am I just noobing here?"

I‚Äôve always read 80 was a good starting point so something in my brain figured better speakers must mean I should go to 60 or lower. I never would‚Äôve guessed I was going in the wrong direction. But something about this configuration works better than anything I‚Äôve tried."

audiophile,"So, for Christmas, I acquired a Gustard X-16 DAC to replace my AudioEngine D1. Absolutely fantastic piece of equipment that I have no regrets for purchasing as the clarity and spatial output from this is truly amazing. Blows the tiny A1 out of the water and sound beautiful. I didn't care about MQA, had just been hearing good things overall about Gustard and wanted to see for myself. 

While I don't think of my equipment as HiFi, More Mid-Fi, it is as follows:

* Wilsenton R8 Amplifier w\\ AMP tubes: Gold Lion KT88s, Preamp Tubes: Psvane CV181s and Tsung-Sol 6SL6
* Peachtree Nova 300 (used for TV viewing)
* Tekton ENZO XL with Array and upgraded caps
* RSL 10"" Speedwoofer \*2
* Rega p6 w\\ Ania Cart run through a FONO MC
* Gustard X16 DAC
* Sony CDP-C445 CD player

I initially bought the Peachtree Nova 300 as a primary amp but found the output to be sibilant and fatiguing with the Tektons. So, I purchased the Wilsenton R8 and fell in love with how airy and holographic everything sounded. While I like vinyl for the aesthetics and ritual of it, I do understand that digital is much more accurate and revealing. That was the reason for getting a new DAC.

My problem is that my RSL subs, while providing bass, do not do so very crisply or there's no punch. I'm trying to figure out if I need to replace the Amp (need suggestions), or the Subs (also need suggestions). I do know I need some sound treatments, but do not think that they would tighten up the bass (I could be wrong).

TLDR: Bass is less than tight, Need help. Is it the Amp or Subs causing the issue? I'm not sure I have enough audio knowledge yet to understand his deficiency but can hear it.

audiophile,"Hi all,

Recently decided to get a great pair of headphones, and went down the rabbit hole reading everything I could for about a week. After trying several units at my local shop (HD 660s, Grado Reference RS1x, Dan Clark Aeon 2 Open, Meze 109 Pro), and a few amps (iFi Zen v2, iFi Gryphon, and some big expensive tube amp), I ended up with the Sennheiser HD 800 S with the iFi Gryphon amp.

Posting this because it‚Äôs the sort of thing I would have wanted to read when I was researching. This is not a thorough or detailed review of any of the headphones, more of a meta commentary on the process, and my conclusions based on my specific preferences.

(Brief about me - I‚Äôm a cinematographer, and have spent time in professional film mixing stages. So I have a peripheral knowledge of sound tech and have heard great sound, but am a beginner hobbyist ‚Äúaudiophile.‚Äù Because of my professional background I‚Äôm biased to seek out accuracy, fidelity to the artists‚Äô intention, etc.)

My primary takeaway:

Reading a ton of reviews was useful to familiarize me with the landscape, but in the end people‚Äôs qualitative assessments had little to do with my own. Many found that the 800 S was boring and lacked bass. While I took this with a grain of salt, on some level I believed it and was expecting not to like it. It ended up being a very clear choice for me.

So essentially (and this has been said before) - reviews are cool, but close comparison was the only thing I found actually instructive. If you don‚Äôt have a shop where you can compare things, I‚Äôd consider finding somewhere with a good return policy, ordering several units, and returning the rest after you‚Äôve made your choice.

I thought I‚Äôd like the Grados based on recommendations from friends and reviews. After trying them side by side I quickly dismissed them. But if I had just ordered the Grados and didn‚Äôt have the chance to compare, I probably would have just stuck with them - having the ability to directly compare made discretion possible.

And on the why of the choice:

The primary song I used to evaluate was ‚ÄúCatch Hold‚Äù by Jonny Greenwood, from the Phantom Thread soundtrack. While I love the song, I focused on it because it has nuanced strings that gently enter, swell, flourish, and disappear. Most headphones/speakers blur these strings together, but I knew there was more detail there than I was hearing, and I wanted to hear it. (I also tested a range of other songs and genres, all via Tidal.)

Of the headphones I tried, the 800 S was the only one that achieved my stated goal. I clearly heard individual instruments and could place them in physical space that felt outside the headphones. Other headphones muddied this or just felt wrong to varying degrees. 

I also thought they sounded great in general. No issues with bass with the Gryphon amp. With the iFi Zen Dac v2 I used the bass boost, and it sounded pretty good if not a little off. The Gryphon was better and has a nice form factor so I went for that.

Conceptually, I spent a while trying to appreciate why people enjoy different ‚Äúcolourations‚Äù in sound systems. This was hard for me to understand - when I‚Äôm selecting monitors the only criteria are accuracy first, dynamic range and colour gamut, so why wouldn‚Äôt sound be the same? The ‚Äúeveryone literally has different ears‚Äù statement is the reason I understand the best (followed by everyone has different preferences). But for me, I figured Jonny G probably wanted those strings presented in a certain way, and everything but the 800 S didn‚Äôt sound right. Granted, I've never listened to this song on a mixing stage, so this is still ultimately a subjective hunch. But the sense of physical space and clarity felt concrete. When listening to other music I found it harder to decide which sound I liked better, it all felt more subjective. So the ‚Äúcritical listening‚Äù goal guided the decision.

That said, people often frame headphone performance as a binary between ‚Äúcritical analysis‚Äù, or ‚Äúmusical enjoyment,‚Äù from which one might conclude that you have to choose to hear things accurately or for it to be enjoyable. I did not find this to be the case. I love how they sound on pop (‚ÄúTame Impala‚Äù), and modern well mastered bass heavy rap. With lower fi recordings (Runnin' by The Pharcyde) you can hear that they‚Äôre not super clean samples, but it‚Äôs still enjoyable. I didn‚Äôt listen to anything compressed, I‚Äôm sure that wouldn‚Äôt sound great, didn‚Äôt buy these to listen to compressed music.

If my budget were lower I would have gone with the 660S and iFi Zen Dac v2, and probably would have used the bass boost, sometimes.

That‚Äôs all!"

audiophile,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm hoping to get some advice for my home theater system as I came across a great deal on JBL HDI speakers that I typically would have never dreamed about getting due to the price and had to jump on it. They are arriving next week but I had a few questions/concerns before I set it all up.

First here is my new 5.2.4 setup:
‚Ä¢ Fronts - JBL HDI 3800
‚Ä¢ Center - JBL HDI 4500
‚Ä¢ Surrounds - (2) Klipsch RS-62 II
‚Ä¢ Atmos - (4) Polk OWM3
‚Ä¢ Subs - (2) SVS PC12-NSD
‚Ä¢ Receiver - Onkyo NR7100

I sit about 9-10 feet away from the front sound stage and while the system is used for everything since it‚Äôs a living room setup (tv, movies, games, music) my priority is on movies.  I also don‚Äôt typically listen insanely loud. For example under normal tv watching or gaming the volume is set to around -30. When really listening to music or watching movies it may go to around -15 but never lower unless the source is a steam that has a lower volume than normal.

I fully realize that my Onkyo receiver is on the low end compared to these new speakers but like I said, I really wasn‚Äôt expecting to get them and since I just got the receiver a year ago I really can‚Äôt upgrade it at this time. 

With that said my first question is even though it is considered lower end, is my receiver good enough to handle the system on its own based on my setup and listening volumes?  And is there a risk to my speakers by using it on its own?

Next question is for any potential ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù upgrades I can do that won‚Äôt cost me the thousands of dollars a new/better receiver would.  Like would getting a cheap 2 channel external amp for the fronts in addition to a couple of speaker level to line level adaptors (since my receiver doesn‚Äôt have pre outs) be beneficial in the meantime?

Any other advice or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!"

audiophile,"I recently purchased a 5.1 channel receiver and hooked up some ceiling speakers that came with the house. There are 6 speakers in total. 

Here's an image of the set up: https://imgur.com/a/ufxLfd9

I've set up the speakers at the TV area to be Front Left/Front Right, and the couch ones to be Surround Left/Surround Right. 

The kitchen and door speakers are much further away, and for some reason are wired together, so plugging one into any of the channels has a matching sound for both speakers. I assume the previous owners did this while setting it up. Since the Center was the only channel available, I just plugged into that, in order to get audio coming out of it.

This works fine just audio eg streaming a song via Bluetooth; but for watching TV, I have to turn off the Center in the receiver as dialogue focuses on those two far away speakers. 

I'm thinking of purchasing an actual Center speaker to be placed just under the TV, which would use the Center channel.

My question is: which channel would I then attach the Kitchen/Door ceiling speakers to? Do I connect the current FL/SL and FR/SR in series into the FL/FR channels, and then the Kitchen/Door into either of the Surround channels? Or do I actually need a 7.1 channel receiver?

I don't care about the direction of Kitchen/Door speakers at all, just as long as they have audio when music is played.

audiophile,"Just finished up my Christmas gift from my wife: the Wharfedale Diamond 240s. 

This completes my our two rooms that we use for entertainment. (We both play video games). The tower speakers are in our guest/office/gaming room, while the bookshelf speakers in our living room. 

I‚Äôve had the Denton‚Äôs since early 2022 and have been blown away by them. Then my wife‚Äôs late grandfather left us the Kenwood, which left me with an extra receiver when I replaced the Denon in the main room. So naturally I wanted to get rid of our small sound bar in the gaming room, add the Denon receiver, and get speakers. Wife‚Äôs Christmas gift to me this year was a budget IOU for speakers in there. I loved the Wharfedale I had so much I figured I stick with the brand. Found the 240s, which are discontinued, in a pair on Amazon for $500. Couldn‚Äôt pass them up.  

Deciding not to pair them with a sub since we live in a townhouse with one neighbor. The bedrooms are upstairs. So went with tower speakers to get a little more bass without needing a sub. 

Sound quality wise these sound great. Still breaking in. But the Wharfedale warmth is there. Not as nice as my Denton 85s with a sub, but that was expected. 

Wharfedale has definitely made me a brand fan."
audiophile,"I picked up a new pair recently, and based on reviews of it and the R700 was expecting a lot more. My old speakers are B&amp;W CM8's, which sounds great IMO. My biggest complaint with the CM8s is that they lack low-end bass and really don't have the energy I want to feel in my music. (Listen mainly to rock and heavy metal) 

Everyone seems to rave about how much bass the Legands and R700s have, but I don't hear that. In fact, I definitely need a subwoofer to fill out the low end. It's definitely an improvement over the CM8s, but not that much. I am feeding them 375 watts at 4 ohms x2 (biamped) so power shouldn't be the issue.

Also, the L600s sound a bit harsh in the highs and almost hurt my ears on certain recordings. The CM8s are so smooth and never fatiguing to listen to like the Legends can be. Maybe they need to break in more?

I'm still tweaking the room placement, but it hasn't helped improve the sound much. Is my equipment not good enough?

I have an Integra DTC 9.8 preamp connected with Kimber Hero XLR interconnects into a B&amp;K 200.5 S2 amp and using Kimber 8TC speaker cables biamped.

My master bedroom is small - maybe 12 x 16. I‚Äôm thinking 2 or 4 speakers in the ceiling. Preferable that they are self powered - aka no additional receiver/amps/etc - and that they are able to be linked to my phone by Bluetooth, maybe wifi.

Does anybody have recommendations?"
audiophile,"This is actually kind of a serious question. I‚Äôm trying to determine whether it‚Äôs really worth it to invest in a better/good turntable. Currently, I have a vintage Audire amplifier feeding Kirksaeter speakers. I have a reasonably nice DAC, and a Tidal subscription. Subjectively, it sounds wonderful. I‚Äôm old enough to remember having to deal with vinyl records, and it just seems like a pain in the ass. Apart from nostalgia, might I possibly enjoy the turntable experience again if I spent some money?"
audiophile,"What‚Äôs up my Audiophilers! 

Got a mega score on Craigslist today. 

Picked up these Monitor Audio Silver 300s with a Episode Evo 10 sub for $500. 

Dude had them way underpriced got lucky I found the ad 5 mins after posting and was local.

Never would of chose white cabinets myself but so far I‚Äôm loving the look. Super clean and matches my gfs vintage motif.  Very high quality build and welcomed addition to the room. 

Coming from KEF Q350 which I loved but wasn‚Äôt confident in them on stands after a little accident on Christmas. Great reason to buy some towers. Harder to tip over!  

Many more hours of listening needed to really give any feedback on the 300s but so far very nice wide sound stage. So far cranking the volume up really sets them free. More detail and bass and big presence. Lower volumes come off flat and reserved. 

Anyways, that‚Äôs my find for the month. 

Remember, life is hard but listening is EAZY üîà"

audiophile,"Hey, so I'm going to state my problem in a really simple way, just for clarities sake. When I use my turntable (Project Primary), be it with speakers or plugging my headphones and DAC/Amp directly into the preamp, the Bass (guitar) is exceptionally clear. But with the same headphones and amp combo, I cannot recreate the same sound via PC. I know vinyl has more treble, and preamps will adjust for that, and I can turn the EQ more to treble on my pc to make the bassline stand out more, but this sacrifices the ""bassiness"" of it. I have tested high quality vinyl rips against the actual records as well. I  know it's not my phones/amp because, as I said, they work when plugged in to my turntable. I use musicbee, but have tried others as well. This makes me think I need another type of device. 

Is there a particular type of amp I need? Do I need to just find something close to my turntable's preamp?

Thanks for any help."

audiophile,"Noob looking for help:

So I am thinking of purchasing Beyerdynamic's 1990 pros.  I have always used gaming headset style headphones (as I primarily use things for gaming, but I also do some content creation), but I'm looking to get a pair of nice studio style headphones, and came to the conclusion these are the ones I want.  That being said, I'm having trouble finding information on a few things (not for lack of trying), and I was hoping some of the good folks of this sub could help me out.

First of all, I have a goxlr mini and am not sure if that will be powerful enough to drive them on their own, or if I would be doing the headphones an injustice without pairing them with a proper amp.  If I do need an amp, how do I properly route them through my goxlr to ensure I get the benefits of both?  Also, does the goxlr mini count as a dac or would I need one of those too?  

Additionally, I want to be very careful so as not to destroy the headphones, and I want to know what mistakes I need to avoid.  Can I damage the headphones if I crank an amp too high?  Can I damage the headphones or my goxlr if I don't route an amp to it properly?  

Or do I even need any of that extra stuff, or should I just plug it into the front of my goxlr mini via the 3.5mm jack and be done with it?  Any and all advice helps, and please don't crush me if I've said anything stupid/ignorant here.  Talk to me as though I dont know what I'm doing, because I don't. 

Thanks!

Edit: If I do need an amp, is there one people can recommend that will bring out the sound to its fullest without any risk of damaging them?

Edit 2: If I do need an amp, I'd like to go to go with budget ones and potentially leave it as an upgrade path later on.  Like $100-200 dollars or so would be fine."

audiophile,"I have been studying and working for almost 10 years to become a fully qualified architect. To celebrate completing my qualification (which is just around the corner) I wanted to buy a really nice speaker setup (bookshelf and desktop only).

My speaker setup has been the same for roughly 14 years: Onkyo A9155 and Tannoy Mercury V1.

Obviously there have been some additions like the SMSL sankrit 10th mkII DAC, the DT880 600ohm, Little Dot mkii and some iems. But I feel like the speaker system could finally do with some revamping. So I was wondering what I could do and how expensive i need to go to really appreciate a difference?

For context I like the sound of the Tannoys, but more generally I like a slightly warm signature, full bodied sound with a slight sparkle (enough to appreciate all the nuanced details).

If it helps my initial thoughts for budget are from ¬£500 - ¬£1000. I can keep the amp if that helps the budget and doesn't impact sound quality.

I've looked at the higher end Edifier range (s3000 Pro for example) would that be more appropriate? I haven't been able to hear them.

audiophile,"I purchased a new JBL SA750 integrated amp a few months ago to connect to my JBL L100 Classics and Rega 1 Plus turntable. I have been loving the setup, but I had a concerning issue a few days ago that I wanted to get advice on.

I was listening to an album in my basement, and when I got up to change sides, I got a pretty good static shock when I touched the tone arm. It caused a pop, and my amp instantly turned off and then back on.

I‚Äôm assuming the amp has some kind of built in protection for static shock like that, and there doesn‚Äôt appear to be any damage done, thankfully. The amp turned back on fine, and the turntable and speakers worked without issue after it happened.

I did some looking around to see a) if electrostatic discharges can damage audio equipment and b) how to prevent them, and I came up with conflicting information and varying solutions (grounding the turntable, anti-static mats, anti-static spray, grounding knobs, etc.). 

I live in the Midwest, and my basement is pretty dry this time of year, so I‚Äôm sure I could use some humidity. But, what‚Äôs the consensus on this issue? How common is it? Is it a problem? How do I solve it?

audiophile,"I‚Äôve been building a music collection in mainly FLAC format.

Work, school, home, the bus, it‚Äôs all good. 

Problem: the best flash drive I could find in the compact form factor I wanted only goes up to 256 GB. At the time my collection could fit in that so I figured it would be enough, but it‚Äôs grown well beyond that and I‚Äôm forced to be selective about what goes on the USB. 

I could buy a whole new USB with more space, spending yet more money and losing the convenient form, or just compress some of the files. My preference at this stage would be the latter.

audiophile," Yamaha RX-V367

Sony str-dh550 


The Yamaha receiver is 10+ years old and is using ""relative volume scale"" (volume goes negative)

The Sony is absolute volume scale (0-99)

I am using a Bluetooth adapter input with 1 red 1 white RCA into an input on the back(not using aux) 

When the volume is at 0 for the Yamaha, there is minimal white noise, and I can increase the volume on the Bluetooth device to an unbearable sound level.

On the Sony I need to set the volume to at least 70. At 70 there is very loud white noise and increasing the volume on the Bluetooth adapter does not even get that loud.

Why is there such discrepancy? 
Sony rated for 90 watts per channel
The Yamaha is 100 watts per channel

Why does the 10 plus year old Yamaha seem like it's 2x more powerful and why does the Sony have a white noise discrepancy? You would have to manually lower them volume every single time with the Sony is not playing anything to not hear the loud white noise. 

It also seems like Ike the Yamaha sounds quality is better, using its ""5.1 enhancer"" eq

Does the Yamaha having ""192 kHz/24-bit Burr Brown D/A Converters"" have anything to do with this?
 
Why is this discrepancy happening and how go find a receiver that will perform like the 12 year old receiver?"
audiophile,"(The title is a little inaccurate, sorry about that. But I don't know what else to set in its place.)

LDAC defaults to 96Khz/32bit reproduction, even when playing audio files that are of ""lower"" quality (CD quality, for example).

Because of that, I've been searching the web, trying to find anything about how LDAC handles this kind of audio files. Some say that it upsamples them, with no reduction in quality. Others say the same, but with a reduction in quality this time. Another guy said that Android only changes the audio stream, with no alterations to the audio file being played occuring.

I don't know whether to change the LDAC settings or leave them alone and stop going in-and-out of the Developer Options.

audiophile,"Hi. Audio enthusiast/pro audio engineer here. 
I‚Äôm not ‚Äùin‚Äù the audiophile community enough so this is a honest question from a curious guy. (English is also not my first language.) 

Why is it that i see so many amazing speaker setups worth so much money, and yet no room treatment? 

It‚Äôs common knowledge in studios that the speakers will never sound better than the room and we spend a lot of money and effort getting the room sound right, or we have a bunch of nasty reflections, standing waves and flutter that totally destroys the imaging and clearity of the speakers, and pretty much nulls the quality of the often very expensive and large speakers. This is the first action we take even after getting decent monitoring as beginners. Reflection absorbers, bass traps, cloud ceilings and diffusion. Easy to build after a bit of learning and studying. 

What is the thoughts about this generally amongst audiophiles? Is it because of the looks? I don‚Äôt think i have ever seen a real bass trap in any audiophile photo. Sure it take away some space and can look rather bad if not done delicately, but it should be all about the sound, correct?

Also, kind of a follow up question, what is your thoughts about studio monitors vs audiophile monitors? And studio grade audio interfaces (metric halo, rme, prism etc.) vs audiophile dacs? 

Honest question this. I mean no offense of any kind. I can‚Äôt stress that enough. Just really curious as to why some things are in favour and others not. 

Best regards

audiophile,"I am quite new to this world, I have a 5.1 surround system built with KEF R500 floor standers, R200c center speaker and R100 as surrounds. I paired them to an older Cambridge Audio Receiver at the moment, but I really can't complain about this receiver. 

I can see everybody talks about the listening to music in stereo, saying this is the right and pure way to do so. I tried listening to the same songs in tidal in stereo and in 5.1. I personally believe the soundstage is awesome in 5.1. The front floor standers are still the ones that are doing the entire work, the music is clearly coming from the front, and the soundstage is right in front of me. Actually the rear speakers I can't really hear, I can't identify instruments or voice coming from them. They are playing, getting really close to them confirms they are producing sound, but in my opinion, they really help reducing echos and reflections from my room. I feel more immersed when playing music on 5.1 than in stereo. 


So, what are the arguments of people that think it's a sin to even have a subwoofer, and music should be stereo and only stereo?"

audiophile,"Hi everyone,

I have owned the regular Tidal Hi-Fi package for a while (mostly because the app on PC and mobile is smexy.) I decided to upgrade to Hi-Fi Plus just to give it a try. I've read a lot of slander about the MQA format but after listening to some mastered tracks (mostly electronic) on a Samsung surround system and my DT 770 pros I've realised it sounds really good. I've listened to a few of the same tracks through a local FLAC file and can say that they sound the same (at least to my untrained ears). Is Tidal actually a scamming company or are people just overly critical? To summarise, I love the way Tidal Hi-Fi Plus sounds on studio headphones and a sound system especially after listening to the same tracks on Spotify and YT music.

Thanks for reading my probably uninformed question/opinion."

Until recently I listened to all my music from spotify, until I found out about tidal and other services with hifi sound.

I have a JBL JS-10BT subwoofer which sounds like 10, but I've seen on the internet that many people use an external dac to make the sound better (I don't have much knowledge on this).

My question is, did you really need this or just connecting the speaker to the pc is enough? Sorry for my ignorance, and thank you."
audiophile,"Hello, not sure where to post this, feel free to redirect me if not here. Looking to know what would be MQA converters. Specifically to use with Tidal.

Any good links that explain it? I stream through the hi-res output of my Mac, then a DAC on the cable (C-type to 3.5mm) converts in analogue I think... THEN it goes to my Yamaha A-S501 Amp that has a DAC. My question is Am i using my Yamaha DAC? or the cable DAC? (JSAUX cable) i can't never be sure tbh. Should I be going from C-type to Optical to use my Yamaha DAC? 

Sound great currently but I reckon I'm confused as to which DAC I'm actually using... the C-Type to 3.5 mm gets connected to a RCA cable that then goes to the CD input of my amp.

And would this amp be able to ""unfold"" MQA or whatever it is?

audiophile,"I am very unimpressed with a couple of Roon‚Äôs business practices. I won‚Äôt go into detail here because morals are subjective and not the point of this post. 

I would like to move away from Roon. I have a mixture of flac files copied from my CD collection using EAC and I also stream using Qobuz. 

Currently I run Roon on my surface pro and the USB output goes into my amp (musical Fidelity M3SI) via USB type B connector. 

I would like to find a solution where I am able to play my local (network) files and stream in a seamless library along the lines of what Roon does. It must be controllable via mobile phone (I don‚Äôt care about control via computer). Good quality meta data and artist suggestions/playlist/radio functions would be nice to have but not essential. 

I am more than happy to purchase hardware so long at is it not in the tens of thousands of dollars range.  Any hardware needs to be able to access my NAS and index/play music from it. 

So far I have found the Bluesound Node which I think fits the criteria. 

Are their any other alternatives I should look into?

If this is the wrong sub to post this into please let me know the correct one as I was unable to find an alternative."
audiophile,"Hey gang, I'm officially pulling the plug and building a proper 2 channel setup for my desk/office. I have a [Niles SI-2150](https://www.crutchfield.com/S-rDjsHvVDQUQ/p_190SI2150/Niles-SI-2150.html) that used to run a multi-room setup of mine, and would be looking to pair that to a NAD C 658.

It would be driving 2, Elac UB52's and will be supplemented by an SB-1000 Pro. I know it has more than enough power, so I'll tweak the gain down a bit, but I was curious if there's any glaring issues any of you see with this setup. I'd rather use a piece of kit I already own than buying something just to buy something. I figure I can upgrade my amp later!

Thanks!

I want to plug my microphone to my Scarlett 2i2 so I can use both my guitar and my mic when on Discord with friends.

**My microphone output is 2,5mm TRS jack. I would like to plug it into my 6,35mm jack input.**

I've found 3,5mm to 6,35mm adapters and also some 2,5--&gt;3,5mm TRRS adapters on Aliexpress but I've hard time understanding why there is so few 2,5 to 3,5mm adapters on the market.

Is this something I should avoid doing due to balanced/unbalanced signals and risks of shorting something out in the 2i2 ?

audiophile,"Hey all,

So I got my LS50 Metas a few days ago and absolutely love them. I have a Q150/Q250C 5.1 setup in two rooms of my house, and wanted the LS50's for my office. They were upgrades to my Kanto TUKs that have served me well for the past two years. I'm a huge fan of the KEF sound, but admittedly my exposure to hifi speaker brands is a bit lacking.

I'm a big fan of ""pretty"" speaker designs such as the LS50 and Monitor Audio Studio.

Now that I have some nice integrated amps, I'm really interested in picking up a pair of Monitor Audio Silver 100 Limited Editions, or the Monitor Audio Studios.

Has anyone heard these as well as the LS50s? Any feedback?

Thanks!"

audiophile,"Traveling around with an LP under your arm is not always handy. So here is a digital solution I came up with. Tell me what you think.

I decided right off the bat not to use MP3 or AAC files. The only way to make music files small and portable is to sacrifice as much waveform as you can get away with. So I wanted tu use ""lossless"" codecs, like .wav and .flac. Also, the larger the ensemble the more microphones and channels involved in the mix. Are the mics high quality or cheap? Were the mics placed properly? Were the channels skilfully mixed? Did the audio engineers fiddle with the EQ?

I decided I wanted one musician playing an instrument that covered the entire audible range. Only one instrument came to mind -  the [harp guitar](https://www.harpguitarmusic.com/instruments.htm). So I explored the intenet until I ran across Tony Barnard on [bandcamp.com](https://bandcamp.com). I downloaded his album in both WAVE and FLAC files, and added the app to my iPhone.

Now I can listen for the clarity of individually plucked strings in the tweeters and woofers, hear how long they ring, and evaluate subwoofers by how well I feel his bass strings vibrating against my chest.

This is what works for me. What works for you?

audiophile,"Hello, so to keep it as short as possible, I live in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and there aren‚Äôt that many options (as much as I‚Äôd like) for surround systems. I used to own the Q acoustic 3050i plus cinema pack (I lost it due to an incident) and I could never get the center speaker to be as clear enough to not require subtitles at all, and felt like the rear/surround were somewhat lacking. I mean, it could also be because I‚Äôm very new to this and probably didn‚Äôt set it up properly. 

Anyhow, I‚Äôve been looking to get a new set of speakers and wondering if this setup below is worth the difference compared to me getting the Q acoustic cinema pack again. (Difference of almost 2k$).

audiophile,"I'm in a position whereby I would like to get a CD player to accompany my NAD C368 to play our piles of old CDs, and the family would like a BD player to play the stacks of old BDs / DVDs. I'm against making the TV area any more cluttered (theres nothing apart from the TV there), and would like to stick the BD/CD player with the NAD (which has a Pro-ject debut carbon sat atop it) at the moment.

Ignoring cries of ""Don't stack it!"" (I'm not too worried as the NAD runs dead cold), does anyone make a full depth BD player? Most seem to be 28CM deep, where the NAD is closer to 40 (and the PJ DC needs about 35-38 AFAIK).

Are there any cons to using a decent BD player as a CD transport, and if so am I likely to find one thats full depth? The NAD has a decent DAC in it, and I'd be using the digital output presumably."
audiophile,"Hello everyone, I am looking for new speakerstands for my Genelec 8351 BW WITH Isopods (Isolation) and found this video [https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/s-anzeige/genelec-8351-highend-studiomonitor-glm-set-messmikro-m-ovp/2311244649-172-3401](https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/s-anzeige/genelec-8351-highend-studiomonitor-glm-set-messmikro-m-ovp/2311244649-172-3401) , which was a bit shocking as there are big differences between speakerstands. Also the metal ones seem to resonate a lot. Then some people say: Fill it with sand and it will be better. 

But I just wonder if the easiest and best solution then shouldn't be to put your speakers (with rubber pucks / Isopods) on a standing basstrap (like in the photo). I think these ones won't resonate as it is made itself to absorb, right? Or may there be any negative sound impacts of usings theses ones as speakerstands, that I haven't taken into account yet?

  The drawers are purpose built to hold cassettes and the two bottom doors open up for record storage. 
  I‚Äôve since sold off the Sony equipment but the enclosures are standard sized and hold my amp very nicely. 
  And for those worried about cooling, it all open in the back and ventilated."
audiophile,"I'm trying to upgrade PA speakers because they only have a tweeter, a horn and a big 300W Sub. Would it make sense to replace the horn with a 5"" 52 - 6000Hz 60W RMS 90 Max Speaker and install a proper 3 way [Frequency-Splitter](https://www.ebay.de/itm/123026437487) thing? (english's not my 1st language sry) 

Also what wattage should I drive the system at, I thought I'd maybe step down the power for the Mid speaker if that's even possible. Or do I have to get a 300W Mid speaker?

&amp;#x200B;

The room itself is for my office/gaming room but is horrible for positioning as my door opens inwards and I have a offset centered window on the shorter wall the opposite end. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've included a sketchup with dimensions of the room and some old photos of the room before I got a new desk etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not even sure I'm going to get decent sound with the speakers being placed on the desk (Close to me) Am new ish to this stuff most of my experience is in car audio. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any helps appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Speakers I'm using at the moment are Edifier S2000 MKIII, which are ran off the pc.   


I'll either be getting new speakers (2.1)  ran seperately off an amp or just a subwoofer to add a bit more low end.

&amp;#x200B;

As an addition to speaker placement. I know the window wall is most likely the wall I should have the backs of the speakers on but unsure how the window effects this (I have a thick blackout blind covering the whole recesss of the window).

Also positioning of the sound panels/bass traps etc would be appreciated

audiophile,"Decided to start ripping my CD collection to Wav now that huge memory is so cheap.

I tried playing one back though and it sounded pretty bad. I assume because the DAC on my 1989 Technics CD player is better than whatever the player I used had (mixxtape, using the line out)

So how do I play these wav files back and have them sound at least as good as the CDs they came from? What do I need? Assume I have nothing, just an SD card with about 500GB of wav music on and no clue what to do next. I have a USB adaptor too. 

I do have a separates system so if there was a product that was that size then that would be ideal. I don‚Äôt really want to use a computer if I can avoid it.

I have no intention of ever stopping listening to CDs, this is purely a backup/convenience thing so if there was a CD player that could play Wav files that could also work. If it played SACD too then even better as I listen to those sometimes too.

I was looking at the arcam s50 and wondering if that might be any good? It‚Äôs a CD/SACD with a 24 bit DAC that you can use externally, and a usb socket. Or perhaps the Sony hi res Walkman, which takes sd cards‚Ä¶‚Ä¶or maybe an external dac‚Ä¶‚Ä¶idk. As long as it sounds as good as a CD player then that would be great.

The only absolute deal breaker is it can‚Äôt insert silence between each track as I listen to is DJ mixes and that would be useless to me. I‚Äôm worried the arcam and the Sony might do that.

Would be grateful for advice from anyone else that listens to digital music in this way on how to achieve this."

audiophile,"TLDR: It is as good as, no, just like K2 936 that costs 6 times more. And it gives you more bass.   

&amp;#x200B;

After K2 936, I was not interested in buying another floor standing speakers. For sure there are thousands of better ones but only if I'm willing to spend over 10K. I dream to get Focal Sopra N3 or Perlisten S7T or DynAudio whatever but not for a while.  

To tame my endless hifi desire, I was considering to get a bookshelf speaker, one with good measurement like KEF R7 or Ascend Acoustics Sierra-LX. Then I came across Polk R700. Excellent measurements, big tower, only for $1100? At best, they will replace MA Silver 300. At worst, it might serve well as a decorative item like Eltax 1969. So I got it.  

Initial impression is that it is just like K2 936 with fuller base. K2 936 is a bit sharper and energetic but nothing major. I really had to listen intensively to find the difference. I had my staff who does not care about HiFi blind test them. She could not distinguish a difference until we listened to bass heavy music. 

MA Silver 300 is quite good but I can tell it's inferior than K2 936. With R700, I can't. 

Retail price of R700 is 1,100 whereas K2 936 is 6,600 USD. One costs 6 times more than the other. Though I had amazing discount on K2 936, it was still a few times more than R700. 

If you are looking for a floor standing speaker for a large room, I wholeheartedly recommend R700. It is a steal. It is rather insane that it costs only $1,100. 

One thing to note is that Walnut finish looks cheap unlike pics online. It might be okay under warm tone light but in fluorescent setting, it looked washed with vinyl tone. As there was no white one, I got the black one and it looks quite good."

Hi everyone!

I recently treated my self to my first B&amp;O speaker, Beosound 2 (2nd gen).

When I initially purchased my product, I thought I could pair the Beosound with my TV (Samsung the frame) purely as a wifi speaker. But after some email with the B&amp;O support, i found out beosound 2 can only be used with airplay, chromecast, spotify connect using wifi.

I was hoping to use as a native wifi speaker without using any of above platforms.

Anyhow, now the wifi options is out of the equation, my tv only has optical out, and beosound 2 has line-in (aux), does anyone have experience or knowledge connecting optical-out to line-in with B&amp;O product? I read some post that this might cause some delay, but i was confused why a physical line connection would cause delay.

If anyone has this knowledge, could you direct me to a proper adapter to use as optical-out to line-in?

Thank you in advance, this page has been helpful starting my B&amp;O journey!"

Only thing that confuses me is ive heard most people say the difference is negligible unless you have a crazy hi fi setup which we weren't using, just some half decent bookshelf speakers with a fairly fancy yamaha cd player and yamaha amp

Spotify was playing through the ps4 through some sort of wired connection I'd have to check exactly what the setup was and spotify doesn't have quality settings on ps4 so i assume it was at very high by default.

Is the difference always really that massive as we could both hear? Or is there either something wrong with the ps4 spotify or something amazing about that cd player

I‚Äôve recently gotten myself a (cheap) turntable. It has speakers built-in, but they aren‚Äôt great quality so i want to connect the turntable to external speakers and a subwoofer. 

I kind off succesfully did this, however i can‚Äôt turn up the volume of the speakers. The turntable itself has a volume controller but it only works for the internal speakers, not the external ones.

My external speakers (logitech Z533) are directly plugged into the turntable (Lenco LS-50WD) via RCA, but they come with a subwoofer. The subwoofer isn‚Äôt connected. The subwoofer has a volume control connected but the speakers don‚Äôt. So i think i have to connect the speakers to the subwoofer to be able to control the volume, but i can‚Äôt because there is no connection for the subwoofer and the turntable (the subwoofer has a 3.5mm jack).

audiophile,"I'm researching what approach I should take when adding subwoofers to my listening room that I use purely for music (no movies in this room). 

I've been crawling through audioscience review's subwoofer comparison thread [https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/subwoofer-comparison.20494](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/subwoofer-comparison.20494) and have found Brent Butterworth's (from Wirecutter) subwoofer comparison spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KjlXBWMPAHgU\_V9DAHSdIZ\_ke0MxwH6ekt3vTIlYOJU/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KjlXBWMPAHgU_V9DAHSdIZ_ke0MxwH6ekt3vTIlYOJU/edit#gid=0) This adheres to CEA-2010 protocols. 

I am looking at the SVS SB-1000 Pro. According to Brent's spreadsheet this can produce 90.9dB down at 16Hz at 1m distance. If you double the distance to 2m, measured output is reduced by 6 dB. If you go from peak values to RMS values, the values are reduced by another 3 dB. This would result in the SVS SB-1000 Pro producing 81.8dB at a 2m listening distance at 16Hz, 85.8dB at 20Hz, 92.8dB at 25Hz etc...

I would like dual subwoofers to help even out the modes in my room so the bass is smooth in multiple seating positions. The SB-1000 Pro appeals because of it's diminutive size, features and value for money. My question is if I add 2 of these, would it impact the results in Brent's spreadsheet? For example, would the dB at 2m be louder than 85.8dB at 16Hz?"

audiophile,"How much delay can be expecten when using KleerNet wireless technology? I am thinking about purchasing a pair of Edifier S3000Pro's but since I am planning to play some games on them as well I was concerned that maybe there would be a noticable delay.

I remember watching an edifier employee that said they carefully calculated in a delay into the masterspeaker to compensate for the delay in the slave speaker, but how much the latency is I don't know. I reached out to edifier and they couldn't provide me with an answer."
audiophile,"Struggling with the choice of amp, hoping you can help me. 

I used to have a really good system many years ago (B&amp;W 805's, Myryad CD player, Doxa 70b power amp, NLE attenuator). It all was gone in a fire. After many years without a good stereo system and not following hifi reviews I just got a taste of it again.

Somehow, not on purpose, just wanted something better than the TV sound, I assembled a ok system. Now it's

Pioneer SX-20DAB
Kef Q350
SVS sb-1000 pro subwoofer 
Ifi zen dac

Had a weekend of alone without kids and wife, bored, so I found a couple of heavy chairs to put the speakers on, setting it up so I could get a ok stereo perspective out of it. The system surprised me bigtime! As long it wasn't happening to much stuff it sounded pretty darn sweet. The bands was in my living room! Wow I loved it üòÉ I listen to just about all genres of music. With a lot going on the amp clearly struggled. It just falls apart and gets flat. The living room is quite big so I need about 60-70w to fill it with sound. 

Ok, so here's to the hell-part:
Looking on different integrated amps, and it seems that rotel kinda ticks all my boxes so far.

At maximum budget: 

Options 1: Integrated amp - Rotel a14 mkII - Can connect optical to tv, stream via my pc and  my wife's bluetooth. 


Option 2:
Power amp Rotel rb-1552 mkII via Ifi zen dac (dac is pretty damn awesome). Audio from TV could still be done, just now so great (cheap Ifi da converter). Is the zen dac good enough as a preamp to the rotel power amp? 

That's how far I got in my thoughts here. Any experiences and advice would be highly appreciated üòÉ"
audiophile,"I'm currently running a Raspberry Pi as my streaming device, connected via USB to a Denafrips Pontus II.

If that's not a worthwhile upgrade, is there a path that makes sense?

Happy holidays yall!

I need a piece of advice from you. I recently got a Sony XP750 for 400$. My main usage would probably be using that to DJ at home parties or somewhere outside where there‚Äôs no power outlet. And mostly for friends and stuff. 

But recently I‚Äôve been questioning myself whether that was a good purchase, because I‚Äôve been reading a lot of reviews on it and now I realize that there is def something better, louder and more suitable for my needs within a similar price range.

Sony XP750 is 75w, and as I recently found out - that‚Äôs not too much. A lot of actually loud speakers go from 1000w as I found out. I rly like the fact that it‚Äôs portable and has Bluetooth, that way I can just take it somewhere where I‚Äôm not going to DJ and still enjoy music, but the problem is that it doesn‚Äôt seem too loud for playing it at the parties. So please lmk your recommendations on whether I should return it before it‚Äôs too late, or if I should keep it. My budget is around 600$, but still lmk if there is something that I should save for. 

Thank you for your replies and most importantly for your help!"

I recently moved and cannot use my old passive bookshelf speaker set up. The new space is really small and for the time that I'll be here, I'm looking for a compact one speaker set up that I can place on a small slot of space on my tv console. 

I'll only be streaming music off my phone wirelessly for casual listening. An option to plug my tv into this setup would be a bonus. No turntables or receivers/amps/DACs at the moment. Just a simple wireless phone-speaker casual setup. BT a definite must, wifi is also a bonus. 

I don't need to move it around as my living space is really small. And this will be the only speaker I'll be using so no need connectivity to other speakers. 


Budget would be under 500usd. Obviously, I'd like to save money where possible but if the performance gains require spending more, I'll definitely prefer to stretch my dollar. 

I've shortlisted a couple of options but would like to know which would help me get the best sound performance, although I understand this setup isn't ideal for peak audio performance. Other options outside my shortlist very welcomed!

audiophile,"Just wanted to come on here and sing the praises of the M2 MacBook Air's DAC. Holy moly is it ever good. I have a NAD D3020 with Wharfedale Diamond 220s and always used NAD's DAC for playback. I either had my Mac hooked up to the USB input or listened through an AirPort Express plugged into the optical input of the NAD. I found the sound too dark and bass heavy, but enjoyable with the right equalization. The headphone output on the M2 has been very enjoyable with a pair of Sony M3s so I thought why not just feed that into the analogue input on the NAD? The result was mind blowing. Greater clarity, very neutral sound, wider soundstage etc. Basically all those sound characteristics I had been reading about finally hit me. I am listening to albums and picking out details I that were previously hidden to me. The M2 DAC can output 24/96 so it's a great fit for my Flac collection and Apple Music. If you have an M2, or even an M1 I bet, try out the headphone output. Listen to Dolby mixes through it with headphones. You'll be amazed. I will forever compare all other DACs to the M2's.

audiophile,"So my headphones aren't plugged directly into my PC. They're plugged into a knob-thingy which gives me control over the volume of 2 virtual audio devices, both of which output to my headphones. There's also a master volume knob.

This is such a simple little device and it's so useful for recording/streaming stuff and managing your audio sources, because it's physical and you don't have to tab out of anything to manage a particular category of programs. 

I put all programs like Chrome and Spotify which I don't want to be recorded on the secondary channel, and my default channel is the primary. So everything not whitelisted to the secondary channel gets played on a separate device, and if I want I can only listen to 10% of the game or 10% of the music and none of it changes the recording because the volume is controlled by the hardware

Do I have to crack it open and check the wiring? It‚Äôs a new cable too so I think it must be the amp/speakers or a dodgy connection somewhere. Sorry for the vague post, not good with speakers/amps but would love some help to get it working again. Thanks guys and merry Christmas"

audiophile,I'm planning to buy an aptX PC Bluetooth adapter for my Liberty 2 Pros and the question is - is the latency between the adapter and earphones bearable for gaming or music creation? Or should I just save money and not even bother.

audiophile,"When using a direction controlled HDMI cable - in my case from a DirecTV box to my TV, does the cable arrow go in the direction from the DirecTV box toward the TV?"
audiophile,My friend only uses his built in TV speakers to watch TV shows and movies. Sometimes I feel like I am being too petty by complaining and not wanting to watch movies when at his house. When I ask him about upgrading he says he doesn‚Äôt know the difference and can‚Äôt tell the difference between good sound and bad sound then proceeds to say the sound is fine. He also keeps an air filter on high that has a loud fan and I think makes dialogue harder to hear but he and his wife don‚Äôt understand how that effects the sound. He holds the TV remote during movies and turns the volume up and down based on the scene and dynamics of the movie. Idk how to get through to him.
audiophile,"Found a great deal on some Ex Demo Technics C700, I liked the look of them and so bought as a Christmas treat. 

Intial impressions has been very good, I thought they would be hard to drive but the topping PA3s has no problem for nealfield/small room like this and gain is set very low. I use the apollo twin for the volume control and as the dac. But am on the lookout for something a bit nicer than the topping, it was just available the same day and has reasonable technical performance for the price. So will do for now. A Vidar II would be nice but too big/expensive for my country, something to stack under the Apollo would probably be best. 

The technics even this close present a very large and layered sound, there's no boomy bass or muddy separation despite not being ideally placed. And I am really enjoying them at the moment."
audiophile,"I have an anthem mrx1140 and plan to increase my system to 9.2.6. I need to add an external amp to drive the 4 extra channels.

My speakers are 8 ohm Revel w893 for fronts, w873 for remaining beds and c763l for atmos

I have two options that I‚Äôm considering
First is to add a $500 Emotiva BasX amp (100 watt per channel) and run the middle atmos and front wides off it.

the second option is to buy a 5 channel Emotiva xpa5 ($1600) with 200 watts per channel and run my front stage off this. Then use amp matrixing to power my other speakers off the anthem. The anthem has 140 watts for 5 channels and 60 watts for 6 channels. I can run my remaining bed speakers off the internal 140 watt amp and the atmos on the 60 watts per channel internal amp

is this worth the upgrade? Any help would be greatly appreciated"

audiophile,"This comes up often enough, in various ways. But someone, perhaps me, orsomeobe else, will post about how gear affects the quality of digital recordings.

Perhaps red book CD's gets this the most, also streaming music.

So one person might post that a cd player, or steaming box sounds better... (insert brand/model the OP was asking about)

...and inevitable, someone will post that it's digital, just ones and zeros so it doesn't matter.. a $150 4k player will sound the same as a $500 cd only player, etc.

It's difficult to explain to the people that those bits of data are converted to an electrical and/or optical signal between reading the source, and ultimately being produced as audio sent to the listener's ears."

audiophile,"Hi, not sure if I am posting to the correct sub.  I couldn't find a Denon sub.

I'm hoping that someone who has a Denon AVR-4700 can help or perhaps someone who has done this successfully.  I'm trying to add to my Karaoke setup, an HDMI signal from my laptop. I had an HDMI in to analog out (audio and video RCA) splitter. This works well, but the video is very low quality.  So I bought an HDMI in to HDMI/RCA out.  

I am trying to take an HDMI signal from my laptop and split it into HDMI out and analog audio (RCA) out.  The analog audio (RCA) is then fed into my mixer and the mixer output into my Denon. In the Denon setup, I assign the inputs.  The Denon input that I want is set to the HDMI port that takes in the HDMI out from the splitter and for the audio portion, I set it to take RCA ports that came from from the mixer.  

In the Denon setup after assigning the input, the last field is the ""input"" type (analog, HDMI, or auto). If I set the ""input"" to analog, I get no audio from the laptop, but I do get video from the mic from the mixer .  If I set the input to ""auto"" or ""digital,"" I get the video and the sound from the laptop, but nothing from the mixer.  

If I go back to splitting HDMI to all analog, it works.  

What am I missing?  Been staring and trying different things and can't get the sound from the laptop to mix in with the mic via my mixer.  Thanks in advance."

audiophile,"Hi all,

Someone recently pointed out that some of the flac files in my collection were in fact not lossless.  
I have read up on this quite a bit since, for example:

[https://hub.yamaha.com/audio/music/how-to-stream-hi-fi-quality-audio-at-home/](https://hub.yamaha.com/audio/music/how-to-stream-hi-fi-quality-audio-at-home/)

And have been using Spek to check the spectogram of my files.  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/xTrill/comments/6fre3q/spek\_guide\_2017\_edition/](https://www.reddit.com/r/xTrill/comments/6fre3q/spek_guide_2017_edition/)

In general, it seems very easy to point out lossy files when they are capped at 20kHz or lower.  
Exceptions being really silent songs that don't reach that high, etc.

However, someone recently gave me an example where the lines seem to be a lot more blurred.  
In this example, one is mp3, the other is FLAC:

[FLAC vs MP3](https://preview.redd.it/hmypwy5k8q7a1.png?width=3125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed4f6cdaee64e75b531c8f5768c9a22efd836697)

You need to really look at small details there to be able to distinguish them at all.  
The left one is the FLAC, the right one the mp3. When directly comparing them you can see the small black gaps at the high frequencies, but if you were given only the right spectogram, I'm sure it would be nigh impossible to tell if it is truly lossless or not.

I've also found a tool to bulk check files to check if they are lossless or not:  
[https://losslessaudiochecker.com/#downloads](https://losslessaudiochecker.com/#downloads)

The article linking to this tool mentioned that they would never fully rely on it as the algorithms are never 100%.  
The devs of this tool put a paper up with more details on how it all works:  
[https://www.aes.org/tmpFiles/elib/20221223/17972.pdf](https://www.aes.org/tmpFiles/elib/20221223/17972.pdf)

I've been going through my collection and found a bunch of obvious tells by looking at the spectogram only.  
I've also gone through a bunch of albums where everything seems a-ok and the Lossless Audio Checker tool marks them all as clean.

But then I've also come across some albums that to my eye look legit in Spek, but the Lossless Audio Checker will flag several of the songs as being upsampled:

[Supposedly upsampled?](https://preview.redd.it/rt3yj21e8q7a1.png?width=1616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bec613c26b2d7136e15251a89a729bcc072e26b)

OK, the files aren't present in the AccurateRip database, but they are all ""Accurately ripped"" by CUETools.  
So I'm guessing the Lossless Audio Checker tool is flagging these as false positives?

  
But then again, think about the near indistinguishable comparison in the first image.

Is there even any exact science to verifying if a FLAC file is in fact truly lossless, or is eyeballing it with these tools the best we can do?"
audiophile,"For me, imaging is one of the most important aspects when buying a speaker. I love it when speakers completely disappear and there is nothing but a 3D sense of music in front of you. I find the KEF LS50s are really good at this. Who else puts imaging as one of the main strengths of a speaker and what speakers have you heard that excel in this?"
audiophile,"I am not an audiophile, but my wife is. She has been building a record collection without a player for a few months now.

It does have an aux, USB, digital, and optical. My question is, what is the best conversion, or can I run 3.5 to 3.5 to avoid conversion completely?

audiophile,"Backstory...

Recently built a PC for mostly gaming and some music listening. I have Kanto YU4 powered speakers on desk and HD 660s headphones. I tried connecting speakers to MOBO with AUX cable but got really bad interference noise, only optical cable fixed this. Then came HD 660s, so I bought a DAC/AMP (JDS Labs Element 3) so I can use optical cable with the Element 3 to computer and headphone audio cuts out very frequently. Plugging headphones directly into computer actually sounds better.

What could be causing this? I'm not displeased with the sound quality from the 660s directly to computer, but I like the idea of being able to quickly switch between headphones and speakers and having a way to control volume on amp volume knob.

Am I going in the wrong direction here?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"
audiophile,"I had the opportunity to listen to these speakers and I cannot imagine that anything can sound better than this!

audiophile,"Forgive me since I know barely anything about speakers or Klipsch. I ordered these for my dad for Christmas because he has tons of Klipsch speakers including corner horns and all that, and he just got a new laptop that I think he would enjoy using with some good desktop speakers.

I ordered it on Ebay since Klipsch doesn't have the black/ash in stock. I kind of accepted that it would unfortunately be too late for Christmas, but there could also be a chance it comes before because I ordered from someone only one state away. However I really didn‚Äôt think the seller would risk it and send it during the current freeze. 

Well surprise surprise, it only took one night and is now currently ""out for delivery"". It's around -10 degrees out today with -30 windchill. I feel like I've heard how really cold temps can run the risk of parts inside speakers becoming brittle and breaking, but idk how true that is? I assume the back of the UPS truck is not temperature controlled and I pray the driver doesn't let it drop to the ground by one single inch when putting it on our porch. Should I be concerned? The ebay seller accepts returns, but I'm still surprised they even risked shipping it in this cold right now and I assumed it would have come after Christmas."
audiophile,"Never in my life has setting up a turntable been so painless - anti-skate that works brilliantly, VTA that can be changed on the fly, and the simple but effective overhang gauge for alignment.

Sound-wise, I‚Äôm hitting myself for many reasons - one of which is why it took so long for me to go direct drive.

This Cisco pressing of Steely Dan‚Äôs masterpiece Aja showcases the Technics brilliantly; PRAT (pace/rhythm/attack) are spot-on with the new SL-1200GR - zero slouch, dragging, or lagging on everything. Dark, open and transparent - with enough depth to peel back layers upon layers on recordings. I love my Pro-Ject for its warmth, clarity and timbre, but I don‚Äôt know how I can go back to it now."

But the sounds is kinda off, I use them to play videogames and the voices of the characters sound kinda off like they do no merge with the music, effects, etc. I know nothing about audio really, so I do not know how to describe it.

I checked the EQ settings of the old headphones and the default is flat, with the new ones I have being playing around with the EQ for like 4 hours and results are a disappointment to say the least. 

I found this online but I do not know if I can use them to kinda match how both devices sound.

audiophile,"Picture is my current setup (not pictured: Cambridge Audio DacMagic 100 - fried). 

Specs:
NAD C 356BEE amp
Sonos Connect
Marantz CD6004 CD player
Technics 1200 mk2
Klipsch Heresy IIIs

Usage case in order of frequency:

1. Plugging in a MacBook to the DAC via optical;
2. Sonos streaming (though I haven‚Äôt been able to get the Sonos player to access my music on the external drive connected to the router since the most recent update to the Sonos player);
3. Records;
4. CDs. 

I‚Äôm hoping the assembled minds can offer some suggestions on an update path. I primarily want to replace the DAC. I liked my DACMagic 100, and got about 8 good years out of it. I‚Äôm looking at the DACMagic 200, but it is a significant jump in price for what seems like a feature set I don‚Äôt really care about, or duplicates the function of the Sonos. Should I just get another DACMagic 100, or venture beyond Cambridge Audio? Is the 200 really worth the extra cost?

I‚Äôm also trying to talk myself out of replacing the CD player. It is skip-prone even on perfectly clean discs, and it is getting harder to turn on. Obviously these factors contribute to me using it less, but come on, it is nearly 2023. How long am I going to hold on to CDs?

Finally, the complicating factor: my work takes me to countries with unreliable power supplies, and mainly 220v electricity. I‚Äôm sure the step-down converters and dirty power supplies have shortened the life of my existing equipment. I‚Äôm no electrical engineer, but I understand plugging line conditioners or UPSs into step-down converters is dangerous. That leaves the gear to make do with the power from the step-down converter and unplugged when not in use to avoid power fluctuations. 

Thanks for any advice or feedback you can offer!"
audiophile,"My system has always been primarily used with an analogue front end. Currently running a VPI Super Prime Scout with a Hana ML cart through a Rogue Cronus Magnum III to Dynaudio Special 40s. I do have a simple Bluetooth streamer in the Audioengine B1. It‚Äôs fine, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm getting the best sound out of Qobuz and my digital files by sending them through my iPhone. I have a few questions:


Would the best single piece of gear to improve my digital front end be a DAC/streamer/preamp combo?


When something like this is added, will hooking it up via Wi-Fi be sufficient to achieve good sound? My internet hardwiring is in a separate part of the house, so I‚Äôm not sure how it could be hooked up directly into the unit. 


Any particular recommendations? Right now, my front runner is the Cambridge Audio CXN V2. I do not need a power amp as part of the combo.

audiophile,"I have been wondering, were sound cards generally better in the past or is modern technology better?

About 20 years ago I had a Philips Acoustic Edge card, that was then considered to sound better than most other cards. It wasn't the most common card back then. Of course PC's had integrated sound cards also, but I think the common opinion was that those were not very good.

Later I had a M-Audio Delta Audiophile 2496, which I think should be able to use in modern computers. Though I'm not sure if it has PCI or PCI Express connection. It has drivers for Windows 7, but not for newer OS's.

At the moment I don't have a separate sound card on PC. I have a DacMagic Plus, but it isn't connected, as I don't listen to music much with the computer. Usually just Spotify through amplifier."

audiophile,"Hello. I have some questions, and I'd appreciate if someone could help me. It regards with sound quality on computers. To start, let's state a few statistics.

Headset : Adata XPG EMIX H20 ( USB plug )

Headphone : Sennheiser HD H400s

Current motherboard with integrated sound card B450 Gaming Plus Max with Realtek alc892 codec

&amp;#x200B;

My old Adata headset recently broke. They were of a cheap plastic construction but they had a really good sound. They had a USB port. Now, I got some Sennhauser and those have a 3.5 mm jack. The sound quality of those is much lower, but they sound really nice when I plug them in my 15 year old 20 dollar Sansa portable music device, which heavily indicates that the problem is my computer.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you help me find what is the problem? Are there computer softwares I could use to improve the sound? Is my integrated sound card that shitty? I'd like some clear answers so I wouldn't need to waste money. I don't understand why I'd buy a sound card or DAC if those USB headsets provides such a good sound for the same price. Any tips is appreciated, also leave me some key words to search on the internet if you got any suggestions."
audiophile,"We have a Fluance RT85, attached to a DJ Pre II, and then linked to the Naim Mu-so. All of these are plugged into a Belkin adjustable outlet surge protector. 
I know I know‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not a great speaker for a hifi setup, but it‚Äôs what I have currently, so meh.

We‚Äôve always had this deafening hum that drove me crazy. 

I upgraded the cables, added the little magnets to everything, changed preamps from fluance to the current setup and nothing. Today I hit a wall with the damn thing. 
And it hit me like a ton of bricks. Since I can‚Äôt ground to the Mu-so, find another powered ground, Dummy!

Sooooo I attached a 2nd grounding cable to the preamp, where the original is, stripped the other end off and wrapped it around the coaxial points that are built into the surge protector.

And just like that‚Ä¶.. beautiful sweet music.

audiophile,"As I understand it, for any given frequency response, I can generate a FIR filter which is the delta between the given frequency response and perfectly flat, with no phase impact.

So why don't more folks do this with their equipment, at least as a baseline before adding desired color?  Or am I misunderstanding the power of a DSP?"
audiophile,"When I started streaming on Twitch, I ensured I had the proper equipment I needed to broadcast (capture card, Camera, PC, etc.). The first microphone I bought was the Blue Yeti, a well-known USB condenser microphone for beginner streamers. In the beginning, everything worked great with the microphone, but sadly after Logitech acquired Blue, getting the Yeti tuned to the perfect sound was becoming difficult for me, even with the experience in audio production I have. I decided I should go to the things I have more experience in; XLR Microphones. I began researching my next microphone with the help of other streamers and references I found on the internet. My goal was to find a great beginner dynamic XLR Microphone, and that microphone is the Rode PodMic.

The Rode PodMic is a Dynamic XLR Microphone designed by Rode, an Australian-based audio technology company with a heavy presence in the United States. The PodMic was unveiled in 2018 and has received many positive reviews for its high audio quality at a low price. The microphone has a cardioid polar pattern, focusing on the person speaking into the mic and blocking the surrounding sound. The microphone also has a built-in pop filter, making there no need for an external pop filter. The PodMic brings broadcast-grade audio into podcasting, live streaming, and recording. The black metal design of the PodMic guarantees the microphone will last for a long time (Note: the only pieces that are plastic on the microphones are the knobs on the sides that lock the swing mount and mic in place).

It‚Äôs been over three weeks since I installed the Rode PodMic, and without a doubt, I was surprised. After installing it to my GoXLR Mini and doing some tuning, I was shocked to get this microphone sounding as if I was using a Shure SM7B (I don‚Äôt own one, but I used one during my college years for recording). The microphone has blocked surrounding sound from my streams (I have two nieces playing in the room above my studio, so that should give a reference on how much noise is above me). Even though I have plenty of positives on the PodMic, one negative still bothers me, and I bet it bothers others who use the mic for podcasting. When I opened the box the microphone came in, there was no plastic cover the mic was enclosed in or a travel bag. The microphone didn‚Äôt even come with a carrying bag, which can irritate those who podcast and travel around doing episodes. Yes, the mic is all-metal, but you‚Äôd want a new-looking mic on camera compared to a mic with scratches all over it. The PodMic should have a carry bag to protect the mic during traveling.

The Rode PodMic has opened the door to affordable Broadcast-grade audio to enter the Podcasting/Livestream world. Besides the mic not coming with a carrying case, its performance and affordability make me highly recommend this mic to incoming podcasters and streamers looking for their first XLR microphone. The Rode PodMic costs USD 99.99 (the same price as a Blue Yeti) on Rode‚Äôs website and other electronic retailers (Amazon, Best Buy, B&amp;H, etc.)."
audiophile,"One question that I see come up a lot is: why aren't there more audiophiles? Why so many normies? I've thought a lot about this.

I think the answer is: For most people: music is enough and hearing music is easy. Really good sound is rare and untapped audiophile converts aren't hearing it. Why? Because you need ALL of the following:

1. Properly engineered and built equipment. (side note: this does not necessarily mean expensive)
2. Proper speaker positioning in #3.
3. A good room: with good dimensions, well managed dispersion and absorption - not too much or too little. (or at least some room correction to overcome real world shortcomings, properly implemented)
4. A good recording ...
5. ... of a type of music that the listener enjoys. 
6. Played not too quietly and not too loudly.
7. A good listener state of mind. 

Now let's do some math with what happens in the real world with each item:

1. Equipment: 99% of the world uses a single bluetooth speaker or mediocre headphones. They hear music. Done. So, we're at 1% already.
2. Real world conditions often prevent optimal speaker positioning -- if a user even gives it any consideration to begin with. So, let's be generous and say 25% get this right.
3. A good room. One might be lucky here, with bookshelves at the right locations, enough but not too many soft things, a high ceiling maybe, but more than likely not. You probably don't have an impossibly cool partner who is fine with acoustic panels and bass traps in the living room. Let's be generous and say 10% get this right.
4. Good recordings. This is easy. But you have to know that such a thing exists and care enough to seek them out. I'll allow 100% because these are known.
5. And a listener needs to like the music in the good recordings. Let's be super generous and assume that the listener thought this through. Let's give this one 100% also.
6. Played not too quietly or too loudly. I'll be generous again and say 100% because ears and volume knobs are readily available.
7. State of mind: I'll go with 25%. A person first must care, have an open mind, there can't be too many distractions, etc.

Now the math: .01 x .25 x .1 x 1 x 1 x 1 x .25 = .0000625  

This means that the chance that anyone who is listening to ""music"" is hearing really good sound is 1 in 16,000 -- and remember, that's assuming a 100% probability that they're listing to a good recording of music that they like at a reasonable volume.

Where is a normie going to get good sound? 

They're not, because they don't now it's a thing. But assuming they do...

Not at a show: the rooms, the music, the distractions, not to mention the intimidating prices, etc.

Maybe at a friend's house? ... If they have such a friend, who happens to have everything dialed in correctly. Possible, but not likely. FWIW: I'm a bit of a fanatic and even my setups aren't life-changing.

At a retailer? Possibly. At least in the Eastern US the economics are such that any retailer with a properly implemented room must sell very expensive equipment, which is a high bar for a non-audiophile to accept. Places with less expensive real estate and labor costs might offer some retail  options.

So, there you go. Not pretty. For dragon-chasers only."

I've tried asking this in r/hometheater, but didn't receive a reply. I mainly interested in this for a home theater. Hope someone can advise :)

I have these in my parents' house, and I'm thinking about moving them to my apartment. The only problem is that I live abroad, and I am not sure if it is worth the struggle. Currently I can't afford other speakers, so if I want to have my home theater, this is my only option.

So my question is - are these speakers still decent for a 5.1 system?

I am using the 2 towers and the center for a 3.0 setup at my parents' right now, and it is already more impressive than the 400 eur soundbar I have in my apartment, but I am not sure how these old speakers would work with a new AVR..?

audiophile,"I think there is a lot of hypocrisy in this hobby. Why in every hifi related video or festival almost only super easy to play vocal jazz is actually played to ""test""/show off how good something sounds? I think the situation got more and more laughable in the last years. Why nobody has the courage to play something really complex like an Emperor track, a Vivaldi symphony or even some electronic tracks? If a setup is really good, is actually proven playing a very complex track. Most vocal jazz used (nothing against vocal jazz of course) is just a female voice softly singing with MAYBE a guitar playing a couple of notes in the background, well, that sounds good on every decent system. And prove me wrong, I'm sure very few people actually listen to this kind of genre on a daily basis.

now i need your help. i might try to get rid of my speakers altogether and give a neck speaker a shot. i still have headphones and i also have my tv connected to my pc. could work, i have to try. but i have no idea what to buy. i am using Superlux HD681B headphones for years now and they got recommended on some audiophile forum years ago (somewher outside of reddit was where i found it). they are crazy cheap but sound great for the price. very long cable, comfortable.  
what i am looking for would be a superlux kinda neck speaker. but they have to be wired and if possible surround sound which would be great for gaming.  


everything i found on amazon was connected purely via bluetooth. even the bose one is not being produced anymore. are there any recommendations from you audiophiles? would love to hear from you."

audiophile,"Hi!

Years ago I bought a set of DALI speakers and Audioquest Rocket 33 cable. The included banana plugs were cheap with a plastic cap and flimsy. They were dropped and instead connected the cable directly to the AVR and speaker. Yesterday I had to prepare the system for new rear speakers and wanted to make some adjustments with the dampners, clean cables etc and here I see that the insulated part of the copper is oxidized and easily breaks when bending. Happened when I wanted to twist the cobber anew. I stripped 2 cm more, twisted and cut off the ""old"" part.

&amp;#x200B;

The cable is plugged into the terminal from above, so it hangs in a nice arc down to the floor, but ergo also more susceptible to bending/cracking when you have small children and cats. The cable is expensive to say the least (500 DKK pr meter) and my thought is, if I again in 2-3 years experience a cable that will easily break due to oxidation? Would banana plugs help? What do I need? The cable is 2x 8mm2 and most banana plugs take up to 6mm2."
audiophile," 

Hey all,

Have been asked to set up a surround sound system for some relatives based on some miscellaneous gear they have lying around. They have a 2 channel DigiTech Hi-Fi power amplifier (AA-0520), 4x Bose Freespace speakers, and a Acoustimass 8 Series 2 subwoofer.

In their old house all these components apparently worked well, and they are asking me to wire up the system in their new house.

I'm wondering how wiring this up and achieving surround sound would be possible. I have linked some pictures below of each component.

I think maybe they were originally running the speakers through the inputs in the subwoofer?

But if so I don't know how they connected the subwoofer to the power amplifier.

Any guidance is very much welcomed."

Is this a specialized tool made only for a single speaker manufacturer (**Rega**) or if there is something similar available somewhere else?

What I‚Äôm worried about is that the S760H I got from Costco is underpowered for the 4 ohm Sonettos. Thoughts on this? My guess is it will drive them loud enough as I‚Äôll be sitting fairly close.

audiophile,"*For those that are interested in Wiim streamers (also posted this over at* r/BudgetAudiophile

I've been testing the Wiim Mini for about a week but finally got the Pro in today.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/lcw6l6g](https://imgur.com/gallery/lcw6l6g)

# Setup

Setup went the same as the Mini, super smooth. Discovery of devices on their Wiim Home app is very quick and simple. Initial update and settings are simple and guided. You just tell it which input/output you're using (Pro has auto detect) and whether you want to set up Chromecast/Alexa or not.

There are some settings that aren't guided. Make sure you go into Audio Settings to tell it what sample rates your i/o can handle and run the audio test.

It's a bit light but build quality feels good and it looks great. The extra full size i/o are great, who doesn't like more i/o?

All of that is great, the pain comes down to the daily use of the app as a music player. It's really not good, if you think Amazon Music was clunky and slow then you're going to hate this.

# Streaming with the Wiim Home app

It's clunky at best. You have to give it permission to access your account. It can't make any changes, just read your library/playlist etc. That sounds fine until you realize you can't add/change/move anything. You can search for songs and play the Recommendations playlist but there's no way to like/add to your library/playlists. You have to go to your app to do that and the go back to Wiim Home to play it.

I have no local files to stream so I have no opinions on that.

# Chromecast (Pro only)

We like to stream to the entire first floor's array of speakers a lot, every day in fact. It's all done via Chromecast groups, so this is a big one, the main reason why I got the Pro. Streaming via Chromecast from the Amazon Music app is capped to 16/44.1 for some reason. All settings have been enabled yet nothing. I've posted on their forum and will update if I get any info on it.

# Final Thoughts

I'll keep it around until my return deadline, but if the sample rate issue isn't fixed I'll have to send it back and wait till it is. I really want to like it, the value is just unbeatable."
audiophile,"A trigger-happy bot doesn't want me to ask this, so I'll re-word this: Our vintage Panasonic RX-DT690 boombox used a bi-amp system with separate amps for the lows and highs (2x18W Toshiba TA8205AH chip drives the woofers, while a Rohm BA5414 chip drives the mids and tweeters apparently). Each speaker (6-16 ohms) has 4 bare wires to power it, and I do not know which kind of amp or mini-amp could drive them. However, another concern is these speakers might not be magnetically shielded, which could be bad thing if used for a PC setup (intended usage). Your insight is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

audiophile,"Hi All

I am wondering if anyone can offer advice on a part or setup for an issue I have with a sub upgrade path im looking at.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently have a Topping e50 and L50 stack running some HD660s headphones. This has a TRS passthrough which I have running to some Presonus studio monitors with front volume control.

I can flick a physical switch on the amp to power off the amp which then outputs to the monitors which works amazingly. 

I am thinking of getting a matching 8 inch presonus sub to add in but this is where my issue arises.

This sub has input and output for the monitors so if I add this in the volume has to be controlled from my source which in this case is my desktop PC. I dont want to do this as the headphones work best with it on full volume and I don't want to have to adjust before I swap the output each time id much rather adjust from the speaker or something which I currently do.

Can anyone offer any suggestions on this? I have been googling away and thinking perhaps some sort of inline volume control box might work between the L50 and the sub? I'm not very clued up on what's available for this sort of thing."

Here's a Sinatra cover that fits the mixing/feel I'm looking for (doesn't have the lyrics I want unfortunately):

audiophile,"Hi there, first time posting, please, go easy on me.
I‚Äôm not very knowledgeable when it comes to audio devices, but I have a decent musical ear. I have purchased a Sonos Arc and Subwoofer from my neighbor who was moving abroad, and I like the sound quality, however, I don‚Äôt have much to compare it to. Not sure how reputable this system is, but I got it much cheaper than at any store. 
I would like some recommendations on what turntable to purchase that I could pair with the Arc. 

Thanks"
audiophile,"Hi everyone, can I get some insight from you all?       
I currently have an optical running from my TV to my DAC. I can use my phone to control what I'm listening to. I also have plex, which allows me to play off the computer I've got permanently connected to the setup.           
The actual question. What would I benefit, if anything, switching to a Wiim pro and bypassing the TV?"
audiophile,Grabbed 4 of these SSK30ED for the cabinets the speakers were busted. Looking to replace with something but looking for any reccos. My budget is around 150 per cabinet.
audiophile,"I recently bought a portable bluetooth speaker for my bedroom and if I crank it to 80-90% it will be more than loud enough for the room and while it does sound good, it's not what I would describe as ""room filling."" I get this sense that not enough air can be moved by the speakers because of their physical size and I really need larger speakers to do that. When I hear larger speakers there is this sensation that more air is being moved and the sound is more encompassing, even at the same loudness level.

Granted, I'm not an audiophile and I don't have the language to describe the sound the way others here do. This is just the sensation I feel when I have listened to larger speakers in the past.

My reason for posting is that I'm trying to decide if I should look into buying bigger speakers for my 200 square foot bedroom, even though I'm not going to play them at a sound volume greater than about 78 decibels. The 78 decibel number is something I arrived at by playing music in my car at a volume I enjoy while taking a decibel reading off of my Apple Watch.

I'd like to enjoy a more ""room filling"" sound but not necessarily have to crank up the volume to levels higher than 78 decibels.

Am I right in thinking that larger speakers are for more than just higher volumes? Or would I be wasting my money if I'm only listening to music in that 78 decibel range?"
audiophile,"Hey all! 

I am in need of some advice as I feel I am drowning in information as I have dove into the world of turntables, speaker, amps, and receivers.

I have an SL-10 that my wife received from her grandparents upon their passing. I have been researching and trying to gather enough information so that I could start putting together a good setup for her to use it. 

I am having a hard time understanding what I need to run outside of my turntable.  Will I need a pre amp and an amp? Will an amp be all I need?  
From my understanding the SL-10 has an internal MC preamp, but some think it is too weak from what I've read.  

Any help in understanding what I do or do not need would be greatly appreciated!   I've researched on and off the past month and I'm just confused at this point.

audiophile,"I‚Äòve noticed that when listening to Apple Music from my iPhone connected via Bluetooth to a Fiio BTR5 that if ever I lose internet connection (while streaming), rather than just stopping the track I get ridiculously loud glitchy sounds like scraping two bits on metal together.

The kind of sound you‚Äôd imagine an authoritarian regime using to immobilise protestors. It‚Äôs so bad I almost fell off my bike once when it caught me off guard.

audiophile,"Hi, today I came to own a pair of eltax lr-6.5 speakers and having decided to keep them, I wanna know a bit more about powering them and getting the most out of them. I'm quite new to speakers as a whole, only ever using headphones for the most part so I don't know too much but I'm willing to learn. My budget isn't tight but I'd like to spend as little as possible while still getting a good end result. I'd like to use these as a left and right for my TV setup in conjunction with 2 advent prodigy tower speakers as rear channels. I have a sub i can get by with until something better becomes available to me but for now, I'd like to focus on getting these 2 eltax speakers up and running

As I don't know too much about it, I'll say this; my current surround setup is a logitech pc gaming 5.1 surround system, while not ideal it's done me well for this long but left me wanting more.

I bought a pair of Beovox Penta's for $400 on FB and am curious what an affordable, versatile home theater receiver might be to get the most out of them.

audiophile,"My Mission QX-2 have a very subtle tweeter hum with both of my amps (Cambridge Audio Evo 75 and Marantz PM6006). 

I can't really hear it unless my ear is literally right near the tweeters, but I just want to understand where's this hum coming from on absolutely 0 volume. If I increase the volume, the hum becomes louder, but only when I crank it really high. On higher volume levels it's understandable, because the noise floor becomes audible, but why on 0 volume?

I've read about ground loops and all that jazz, so I disconnected all input cables from the amps, and left the amp the only device plugged in a single outlet (EU btw), but nothing changed. I tried moving the power cable away from the speakers cables, but that also didn't help. I also tested different speaker cables.

I'm not too bothered by this, just want to understand the technical reason for this, because that just seems odd."

audiophile,Found this pair of JBL 2050s at a thrift store for $20. I don‚Äôt really know much about speakers but they work great for what I‚Äôm using it for (I‚Äôm a bass head so might have to spring on a subwoofer). Was this a good deal and what are some good entry level subs?
audiophile,Sorry if I didn‚Äôt word that correctly.

No doubt, science and computation *have* played important roles, but consider this, from a recent *New Yorker* article by Rivka Galchen about the Geffen Hall renovation. Galchen is interviewing Christopher Blair and Paul Scarbough, the two main acousticians on the Geffen Hall project. ‚ÄúIn the past, acousticians relied primarily on what was easiest to measure‚Äîthings like frequencies and reverberation times,‚Äù Galchen wrote. ‚ÄúBlair, in an essay on concert hall design, noted that this started to change in the nineteen nighties, when acousticians  ‚Äòbegan to rely more upon their ears, informed by precedence than their measurement devices‚Ä¶‚Äô

 ‚Äò‚ÄùBy the time of the tuning rehearsals, it‚Äôs entirely in the ears, ‚Äú said Scarbough, the other acoustican, quoted in the article. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do measurements to document it, and measurements get you to ninety percent, but the ears get us that last ten percent‚Äù."

audiophile,"This is a brief review of the Topping Pa5 amplifier, coupled with commentary on its major issues. The Pa5 has been discontinued, but there is a mkii variant that is set to release in 2023. See bottom for TL;DR.

The Pa5 came in a diminutive chassis, with your choice of four different colours. Its power was rated at 65w rms at 8 ohms, and 125w rms at 4 (1% THD) at \~4v. The unit itself was bare-bones, with only two pairs of TRS inputs, a volume knob, a front-facing standby switch, and a front-facing input switch. 

To me, it sounded perfectly fine- It wasn‚Äôt dry or thin, it didn't do anything funky, it had an inky black background, and had a great grip on the bass. No matter the gain, there was never any noise/hiss, and it had strong imaging.   
I was relatively happy with my Pa5 for a while- it did everything that I needed to perfectly... but then it failed. Twice. Both units failed in roughly the same amount of time, in the exact same fashion. After roughly 4 months of use with several active hours a day (3-6 hours of sending a signal through it), and 18-20 hours a day of average ""on-time"" throughout those 4 months. The left channel became quieter than the right, and significantly noisy. This happened to me, as well as dozens of other people, as shown here: [Poll for Topping PA5 owners](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/poll-for-topping-pa5-owners-only-please.33293/). A lot of people experienced similar issues within a similar timeline. Most typically, people start running into issues as they approach or exceed 1-3 thousand hours spent with the device turned on.

It's probable that low quality and short lifespan devices used in the Amp started to fail after a few months. [Here's a theory that one person thought up on the same poll from Asr ](https://audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/poll-for-topping-pa5-owners-only-please.33293/post-1346422)‚Äã

[Post by a Topping staff member in the ASR forums](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/poll-for-topping-pa5-owners-only-please.33293/page-25#post-1246970)  
In this post from mid-july, Topping admits to seeing higher-than-normal failure rates in the Pa5, and justifies not recalling it by saying that it won't harm any devices other than itself. They went on to say they will fix the issues with the Pa5, and In their words, ""As a responsible manufacturer, TOPPING will not sell products to the market knowing that there is a problem with them.""

Hm. On one hand, there haven't been any user reports of failure with purchase after this date on ASR. On the other hand, it's likely that purchases of this product have decreased as time has gone on, and it's seeming awfully convenient that the Pa5 was discontinued for no other evident reason. 

After sending out a slurry of emails to both distributors and Topping themselves, this is their narrative:  Topping audio has had supply chain issues, so they've decided to discontinue the Pa5, and create a MKii slated for launch sometime in early 2023. 

Okay, but what's the big deal here? Well...

There was never a recall of the Pa5. There was never any forewarning of the discontinuation of the product, and there still is no explicit, publicly available message that it has been discontinued. Furthermore, I do not know a single person who's Pa5 has broken- regardless of retailer- that has gotten their money back for this defective product. When *I* reached out to Apos audio regarding the state of my second return for the Pa5 after three weeks of silence, they told me I could get a unit in blue (I ordered black), or wait at least 3 months or more (by their estimate) to get a hopefully non-broken mkii unit. 

The Pa5 seems to be another example of a disturbing trend in the industry. But regardless of that, the Pa5 is not worth purchasing secondhand, no matter the price. The likelihood of failure is high, and better options exist. 

TL;DR: The Topping Pa5 seems to have a high likelihood of failure after 1-3000 hours of ""on time."" This issue persisted at least through the first 6-8 months of its sale (November 2021-June/July 2022) and may have lasted through the entire operational life of the amplifier. I haven't heard of a single person that has been able to get a refund for the Pa5 after returning it under warranty- even if they returned it as the product has become discontinued. This seems to be another episode that showcases a concerning trend for the industry and Topping as a brand. And this goes without saying: Don't buy the Pa5 secondhand."

audiophile,"Hello, I wanted to move to HIFI by buying a pack Kef LSX II + Subwoofer Kube 8b.

I had previously the 2.1 Edifier S350DB system that I loved especially at the level of the bass which was dry and which took in the body.

&amp;#x200B;

After a few hours of listening I am under the charm of the KEF LSX II speakers, but very very disappointed with the subwoofer that I find very weak at low volume in spite of the adjustments on this last one to the bottom. And very slimy, drooling at high volume without taking to the body.

I listen a lot to hardstyle music with big kicks, and with the Edifier subwoofer, the kicks were very gripping and precise.

With the kube8 I find that it is very scrambled, a tremor in the background, without making the subwoofer vibrate at the precise moment of the kicks... 

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning I thought it was due to the RCA cable which was not in stereo, I changed cable, always the same problem.

&amp;#x200B;

On my kef equalizer application I set the subwoofer volume to maximum and the speaker/subwoofer balance to subwoofer so that the subwoofer takes care of the bass but nothing happens.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this subwoofer needs a break-in period before it can show all its advantages ?

audiophile,"Well, how do I start?

I'll admit that I haven't completely grasped the concept of phase shift, and thankfully, this post isn't about the nature of phase shift.

It is known that altering a frequency will introduce phase shift, which distorts the sound, even if it is in the inaudible levels. The less the alteration, the less the phase shift.

However, when tuning headphones with a very uneven distribution of frequency volume (Over-emphasized bass-range frequencies, suppressed mid/treble-range frequencies) ""major"" phase shift is unavoidable, due to the drastic changes that need to occur in order to reach a more balanced sound profile.

I've read that when boosting good frequencies and cutting bad frequencies, phase shift is minimized. Does that boosting/cutting equate to lowering bass and upping mid/treble in the above example, and is this statement about phase shift minimization true?"
audiophile,"So I'm getting into binaural beats and isochronic beats(they have effects on the brain and body) and I'm trying to use high frequencies such as 18000hz(mosquito frequency, unaudible to adults) to create an isochronic beat that i cannot hear so I dont get annoyed. But when I repeat the 18000hz file I hear clicks in between. Is it possible to oscillate 18000 hz at a lower frequency such as 120hz without the clicks?"
audiophile,"It seems counterintuitive to me because they would be 180 degrees out of phase and act as the own noise canceling, or if they are somehow turned to not be 180 degrees out of phase they must be at least somewhat out of phase and extend/muddy the decay of the bass.

audiophile,"Hi, I currently have fiio fh3 and mangird tea 2, I'm happy with those but I want more detail, resolution, and better bass I'm willing to spend up to $800.
I'm considering:

Sennheiser ie600 ( I think they might be the best for the price and the most comfortable so I could sleep with them, but having only one dynamic driver makes me wonder if it has enough bass and details) 

Thieaudio Oracle (I think this is maybe the best tunning but I don't know if there are enough details and resolution)

Fiio Fh9 ( this might be the most fun experience and I can get them for $500 so for the price I can get them it might be a great option but I'm worried they are not that great in the technical aspects )

Moondrop Variations ( this might be what I'm looking for but is there enough bass? )

Thieaudio Monarch Mkll (okey this really destroys my wallet but I can save up more, I think this might be the best of the best but I'm really really woried that it disappointes me or doesn‚Äôt fit )

Conclusion: I'm really in between Monarch Mkll and Sennheiser ie 600
I also want to buy a nice Iem dac amp maybe fiio k3 nothing really fancy so what do you guys recommend.

This will be probably the last Iem I buy so I really want something that amazes me, make me go wow. I enjoy all types of music but I mostly listen to artists like daft punk, caravan palace, Radio head, Michael Jackson, Jungle, Arctic Monkeys, Bee gees, Earth Wind and fire, Fleetwood mac, Eminem,Natalia Lafourcade. pop, Rock, hip hop, you name it."
audiophile,"Well, I yanked the  Audio Art SC-5 Speaker cables and installed the Kimber Kable 8tc's that I had laying around and wow what a difference 70% of my too bright issue is resolved. The crazy thing is with the Maggie .7's the Kimber 8tc's sounded horrible and the Audio Art cables sounded much better. I am still going to work hard on the room acoustics, panels, rugs the usual and then I think I will save up and try a Pair of MIT cables. The 8tc's are obviously rolling off the upper midrange and pushing up the bass and although that is what this room needs right now I would like to be able to use a more neutral cable if I can get the room to play nice. Moral of the story is Synergy is a bitch. Its not as easy as saying this product sucks and that product is good. In the right conditions connected to the right equipment you never really know what you are going to get. It sucks that its trial and error with very expensive components but its also awesome in that you can continuously tune and tweak looking for that perfect combination that provides the perfect synergy :) 

You have to love and hate this hobby but it keeps pushing you to try the next thing!

audiophile,"
Hey! I am a beginner 30 y old male. Probably my ears are not trained to identify the music that precisely, but i am unable to feel the difference between 560s and 300cx (https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-US/p/cx-300s/).

I am listening to 96 KHz, 24 bit Vivaldi Four Seasons flac files on my Android 13 (Samsung one UI 5) using HiBy player, Apple usbc to headphone jack adapter. I am not using an external amplifier as the headphones are more than enough loud for me.

Can someone tell me what exactly to feel like or what to observe? I am familiar with the terms Soundstage and imaging but i dont feel it."
audiophile,"Before I get any flack, I‚Äôm more than aware I cannot hear frequencies above 17,500Hz, and I‚Äôm aware that audio engineers filter frequencies outside of the DAC‚Äôs parameters to prevent aliasing. I‚Äôm just interested in getting audio as close to the original source as possible, and if it‚Äôs offered, I want to try the feature.

So having said that, Apple Music has offered hi-Res lossless audio for a while now, the only problem is that almost no playback method can take advantage of it. I have an audio interface that is capable, but my computer is in the other room, and I don‚Äôt want to have to bring it out to my home theater system every time I want to listen to real Hi-Res music.

Apple Music claims to stream up to 24bit/192kHz music, but Apple‚Äôs latest and baddest 4K Apple TV only supports up to 24bit/48kHz audio according to their own website, and airplay 2 is even lower (16bit/44.1kHz as far as I know). I have a strong feeling that iPhone‚Äôs DAC has horrible quality through the lightning connector, so that‚Äôs not an appealing option to me either.

How can I playback true 24bit/192kHz audio through my more than capable home theater system?



**Side note: does anyone know the bitrate of Apple Music‚Äôs Dolby Atmos playback? Is the bitrate divided between how many speakers I have, or if it‚Äôs a constant the same way apple‚Äôs stereo AAC files are 256kbps?"
audiophile,"I've recently moved to an apartment where the main room is not rectangular - rather, one of the rooms long walls is skewed so as to not be parallel to the opposite wall (I believe this shape is called a trapezium). I've tried without much luck to place speakers on the short wall, spaced out on the long wall, and a few other spots with limited success - eventually I just gave up and stuck them in a square office/tv room. But this made me wonder whether others have run into these sort of problems with ""weirdly"" shaped rooms and how folks have handled speaker placement. Recommendations for my case appreciated, but I'm more interested in hearing about the sort of ""weird"" room challenges others have encountered."

audiophile,"So I've gone through a fair few headphones trying to find one that are comfortable and sound good for pc gaming and listening to music via my desktop. Presently, I have a vmoda crossfade 3 I bought a while back. I've tried a few eq mixer programs to try and improve my audio with them, but nothing I try is making them any better. There's an aspect of the audio that I can hear, but can't describe as I don't know what is going on beyond simply not sounding right. Previously, I was using a set of astro a50s for my computer, and a pair of skullcandy skull crushers for use at work. Both of those sound fine. The sound from them is full, and for a lack of knowledge best described as accurate. 

I've been looking at the widest frequency range, as previously choosing by that metric had previously given fairly decent results. Picking these vmodas shows me pretty clearly that isn't enough to go by as they sound awful. Tinny and,  I dunno, distant? I'mma go with that. The balance just seems off. Can anyone give me some advice or point me to where I can learn what I need to know to make a purchase that isn't gonna feel like I got ripped off?"
audiophile,"Frequencies have properties that can assist with things like restfulness, stress, relaxation, meditation, anxiety, yoga, insomnia and more as they oscillate back and forth, resonating with our ear drums and become energy transmitted to our brain as we perceive the pitch.

I've been experimenting with them during my meditations and I don't regret it at all. I've had great results and it's given me an ambition to create my own frequency tuned music to do my meditation and yoga to. I'd really appreciate some constructive criticism or opinions about my work!

There are very expensive amps out there. But if I'm after just a very clean and transparent amp that will unlock the full sound and resolution of the Utopia, is there a need to spend a lot of money?

audiophile,"I've used my Hifiman HE400S open-back headphones plugged into the headphone jack of my Denon AVR-X1400H receiver (via a 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter) for years. We're talking at least 6 years of near-daily use.

Today, for the first time, the headphones shocked me, twice. Once while plugging it into the receiver (while the receiver was powered on) - my fingertips touching the headphone jack adapter got a small shock as I plugged it in, and I saw a little white spark.

The second time was while sitting on the couch and taking the headphones off - I got a very small shock when my fingers touched the casing of the ear cups to remove the headphones.

I have unplugged the headphones and powered down the receiver. Needless to say, I am not eager to troubleshoot this problem further by trying other headphones, or trying these headphones with other sources, to see which combinations of gear will electrocute me.

So I'm wondering if anyone can say **whether this is likely a problem with the headphones or the receiver so I know which gear has gone bad** and needs repair/replacement, and so I can avoid electrocuting myself or my family in the meantime."

These tubes are good, but you really need to tue roll with NOS tubes.

Belvu good Mazda even better. The Mazda had better be better as these are going for US$110 a tube.

I bought the JAN GE 6189W for A$20 a tube here in Melbourne. Tried it was axlittle underwhelmed. Then rememberd I had to use the Ensemble Tubeson on my Amperex 12AT7s in my preamplifier to make them sound any good.

With the Tubesox in place, the 6189W is, in my system, better than the Mazdas.

Maybe we need to treat all tubes with respect and try damping, even if the tubes, like the 6189W, are military grade tubes with supposedly low microphonics.

The 6189W tubes were manufactured into 1986 so there might be plentiful supply making them relatively cheap.

However, a lot of Atmos music and movies aren‚Äôt mixed properly and doesn‚Äôt sound that great and are few and far between.

IF they were still in production I would be inclined to buy them, but I refrain from bying them used, as I know how fragile the treble is and as far as I know, it is not possible to buy spareparts for them.

For now, I have been mostly a headphone enthusiast.

Previously, for my living room setup, I simply connected my pair of Genelec speakers directly to the headphone jack of my TV. What would be the simplest way of doing the same with the new TV models without spending a huge amount of money for an amp?

Many thanks in advance :)"
audiophile,"Hey all. I inherited this thing from my pops. He always talked about how bad ass this thing was and I‚Äôm looking forward to jamming like he used to with my kids. 

My uncle was able to repair things to get it up and running but the tweeters in the Klipsch speakers my pops had are blown and on back order. 

I‚Äôm looking to drop $2-3k on some vintage (vintage looking) speakers that can put the stereo through its paces.  

I‚Äôm a complete layman and would appreciate some recommendations on brands, models, and specs to look for! 

Thank you so much."

audiophile,"
My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt have Reddit but the speaker and stereo boxes he makes seriously blow my mind. So I had to share. 
He built this speaker box/ table set up in four days for his parents Christmas gift. It is loud as hell. Tweeters on top and bass on the bottom. With an adjustment knob box. 
Backstory: I grew up with my step dad being a bass head, going to competitions so I‚Äôve known bass my entire life. 
The speakers my boyfriends makes are insane, the best I have heard. This set shakes the house but isn‚Äôt even close to our loudest. Our neighbors know what we are watching and when we are watching, we live in a house not an apartment and have 4 acres. We are LOUD to the point where my boyfriend has build and donated speakers to our neighbors so they can match us. He truly amazes me. 
He builds the boxes, sands, burns, and stains them as well as cutting and measuring everything. (He also builds tables and other furniture as he wishes, as you can see in this picture the bottom box is built into the table) He buys the speakers in parts and puts everything together, as well as connecting all the wires, his wiring skills are impeccable. 
He builds all of this from just parts and scrap. He sketches all his ideas in a journal, comes up with all of this all on his own. 
I will definitely share more of his work but this is just so genuine, I had to post it. He has spent the last 4 days making this and his parents (experiencing health issues) need some joy in their life and as huge music lovers I think this will be the perfect uplift they need. I just feel bad for their neighbors, I guess we will just have to make them a set too.

Monitor Audio Gold Speakers (2 Fronts, Center, 2 Sides)

Front right every now and then will start creating static, out of both the tweeter and the cone.  Intermittent as in, one week it will happen twice, and won't go away, and then it finally does and it doesn't come back for 3 weeks.

I replaced the cable, and I literally just moved and set up the system in a new apartment, same intermittent issue out of the same side. (Issue started before the move).

Unfortunately I can't confirm whether I set the fronts up the same way or swapped after moving.

How do I diagnose whether it is the receiver or the speaker?

Power cycling the receiver just now eliminated the static but I'm not sure if that confirms it's the receiver or not.

Thanks for your advice!"
audiophile,"G'day,

I have an old Technics SA-EH760 Stereo system that my parents bought back in the day. Over the years we have gotten rid of some of the speakers (center speaker and the two surround speakers), so we are only left with the two main speakers.  
I have set the speakers back up for them on our new TV which is great because the quality is really good for such an old system.

It plays music extremely well, but the only problem is without the other speakers when watching Movies or TV it is really quiet when there's speaking but the bass parts and music is very loud.

I imagine this problem is because of the missing three speakers, so I was wondering if there is any speakers I can buy to help fix this problem?

audiophile,"I am having the hardest time figuring out what in the world is wrong with my setup. The sound quality deteriorates and within a couple minutes it's unlistenable.

The current Setup:

Turntable: Yamaha YP-D071. Had it for ages, runs great.

Amp: Yamaha R-5. Given to me by a neighbor who said it works perfectly fine.

Speakers: Sony SS-CS5. Bought just a few weeks ago.

The sound is very inconsistent. I usually get an insufferable amount of fuzziness out of one speaker to start with. Almost sounds like clipping, but I don‚Äôt ever have the volume turned up even past a quarter. One speaker is significantly worse than the other. The sound is almost unintelligible - just crackling. The problem advances in different ways, but it usually involves one speaker (the same one every time) getting worse and worse until there's no sound besides the occasional crackle coming out. Then after 10-15 minutes the other speaker starts doing the same thing.

If I swap the connections, the problem switches to the other speaker. If I replace all the wires (14-gauge speaker wire), the problem is exactly the same. 

The problem occurs on any input - from the turntable, the radio, and when plugging an aux cord into a computer or phone. 

The problem has occurred on 2 different turntables (current one and a Pioneer from the 80‚Äôs) and 3 different receivers (the Yamaha, a Denon DRA-300, and a Kenwood from the 90‚Äôs). Any thoughts? I haven't a clue what's going on."

I noticed significantly better sound quality, and since that setup is gone for me, I never had such a ""dope"" from music.

Can you recommend anything that is even better than that (at least twice as good) and it won't break the bank?

It must be wired to max out quality at affordable price and headphones (not earphones), and it must play from both Linux, Android and Windows.

I am planning to play FLAC files to have the maximum quality.

Could you recommend a headphone and eventually a player hardware booster like a DAC or anything else, that could be used with all 3 operating systems and hardware?

Possibly some hardware that supports Spotify too, hoping that the maximum quality on Spotify can be audiophile with the proper hardware.

I guess the cheapest would be to buy an audiophile player together with the headphones, that is able to connect to Spotify or to my cloud service of choice?

Thanks in advance.

(my setup had the quad DAC from the phone, and that headphone was engineered for good vibes energy sound by Sennheiser, so it was quite a dope)

I mostly listen to melodic, good vibes, gut feeling, solar plexus, ""dope"" music (my playlist:  [Spotify ‚Äì 2021](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2dCsbWjxFnMUq47deiNGON) ), so the goal is not a headphone that sounds realistic (the most expensive ones, I think), but an audiophile headphone and hardware player that produces good vibes, for melodic music, that is good for gut feelings, vibrations, etc."

iirc, someone once mentioned to me that roon has lossless volume?  

I always thought of roon as a pretty place to keep all of your locally stored music combined with Qobuz or tidal.  I don‚Äôt have a ton of locally stored music, so I never gave it much thought.

Is there really any benefit of using something like this or will I just get degraded quality? 

I have read of programs like Volumio, which puts everything from Apple Music, CDs, Spotify all in one place, which also sounds like a nice benefit.

Buying and selling new and used equipment online is practically (if not financially) effortless. Given the reach of online marketplaces (eBay, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace) it's so much easier to sell or buy stuff to help you upgrade. With a wider audience, you may get more for what you're selling. With more competition, your cost to buy may be lower. 

Pre-internet, what were the options? Specialty stores that may or may not sell used equipment. Ads in your local newspaper. Plus, there is so much information on equipment (some better than others).

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this isn't too off-topic, but I assume a lot of people here might have interesting approaches not only to listening to music, but also to collecting and preserving it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to leave streaming services. They ruin my already chaotic and unfocused listening habits and I remember how much more I was invested in the albums I used to own physically. But I don't want to go back to CDs or vinyl because thats simply not how I end up listening to the music. I listen on my phone or when I am at my PC. Also a lot of music isnt released on CD anymore and vinyl just doesn't work for me fo reasons that we don't need to discuss here.

&amp;#x200B;

But digital files are just soooo boring and lifeless. Its just some mp3s in a folder and with a bigger collection, it might soon again start to feel similar to the endless ocean of Spotify music. It lacks the personality of a album we hold in our hands, with interesting artwork and a special physical place in our collection...

&amp;#x200B;

So I am asking: is there any innovative way of making the process of collecting and playing digital music more fun or satisfying? More personal? How do we give personal meaning and memories to a digital album? How do we avoid forgetting special songs in the endless list of folder/filenames on our PCs?

audiophile,"Hey Guys, 

I'm about to pull the trigger on a new set of 703's or perhaps 702's Tomorrow and was wondering if I should also consider adding a power amplifier to my setup.  I've so often seen reviews mention that when adding extra power to the setup, speakers just sings.. any speakers that is, not specifically B&amp;W's.

&amp;nbsp;


My setup is currently a 7.1.2 using the 600 series, but decided to upgrade my Fronts to 700's for Music listening.  I'm wondering if I should also consider adding a Power Amp for added benefits.  I had initially thought of simply adding an Integrated Amplifier with Home Theater Bypass, but I really appreciate the Room correction that the Cinema 50 provides.  I should mention that my source is a RS250 from HIFI Rose.

&amp;nbsp;

Would there be any sound benefit for Music listening by adding a Power Amp and using the Cinema 50 as a Preamp, as it provides 110 watts in Stereo.  I was thinking either the Emotiva BasX A2 or a Rotell RB-1582 MkII, each being 160 or 200 watts respectively.

&amp;nbsp;

I'd love any insight into this.

Thanks"

audiophile,"Curious is anyone has had this combination before? I had some Polk R100s, but unless I blasted the volume, they didn‚Äôt feel like they were filling the space. At higher volume, they sounded good, had depth and seemed to present pretty well. So, my thinking was, let‚Äôs go bigger and get more punch at normal volumes. (Forgive the terminology, new to the life). So I went to the MA‚Äôs. And while they produce more power at lower volumes, they sound a little sloppy in the male vocals, and the bass. And they very rarely seem to have much dimension or depth. By contrast I have a denon something avr and 2015  kef q100s and kef center channel, and importantly audessey, and they sound very 3 dimensional. 
I wonder if it‚Äôs worth going down the minidsp route to try to do room correction, or if this amp/speaker combo is problematic, or maybe just my ears aren‚Äôt MA ears. 
Open to any feedback, love the look of the speakers, love the volume, but having trouble finding the sweet spot."
audiophile,"Most of my time I‚Äôm listening to music while at my pc while playing games. So I want the games audio and my music.
While Apple Music lossless still sounds a  tiny bit worse than the same song from cd (could be coming from my setup), but it‚Äôs great nonetheless.
And while I like Spotify, it‚Äôs just not as full as the other options even with highest settings. 

Right now I‚Äôm connecting my phone via aux to my motherboard microphone input and let it play back into my headset. Sounds better than Spotify , but I feel like there are a lot of drawbacks. Especially when considering an amp+dac. 

Because the music will go through the phones dac and amp, through one cable, through the next d and a , another cable, then a desktop d and a and finally into my headphones. 

Right now the simplest option I can think of is a 30 bucks audio mixer where I simply plug in pc and smartphone audio into one headphone output (plus d and a between mixer and phone).

How do you do it? I specially when you also use a desktop setup. Or maybe a workaround to get Apple Music with lossless on windows.(Apple Music works in the browser, but you can‚Äôt adjust the quality).

I know this is a setup question but in that setup thread only one guy answered and it didn‚Äôt really help. I feel like the way I try to do it is a little different to most setups that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking."
audiophile,"Does anybody own both of these? Is the Aiyima an improvement over the A400 in any respect other than better power consumption? I have the A400 and I find it a little too bright for my speakers (Heybrook HB1 S3)  and I'm hearing nothing but great things about the Aiyima.

Thanks!"
audiophile,"I have been using the amplifier for a week.

 In my case, I used this amp to drive a pair of Klipsch KG2.2 speakers that I bought a while back on Ebay. KG 2.2 speakers have a sensitivity of 93db. That's a little bit higher than average, and this amp drives those speakers to very high volumes! If your speakers are less sensitive, the volume will be lower, which is the case no matter what amplifier you're using! If you're using this amp in a bedroom or small office, it's probably gonna be loud enough with any speakers you have. But if you're driving 87db speakers in an 800 square foot room, it's probably not going to get very loud. If you like to shake the walls and anger your neighbors, keep that in mind. 

I'd say this amp will drive speakers to about the same level as a typical mid-level class AB receiver in the 50-70 watts per channel range. Beyond those levels, you start getting distortion that you can hear, and that can damage speakers. But that's shouldn't really discourage you...with moderately sensitive speakers, 50-70 watts is pretty darn loud! 

 So far I have to give a big thumbs up and gold star to this little, inexpensive, amp.  


It's nice to see a manufacture use a subtle LED power on light. It's so subtle that at first I thought it didn't have one. If you're sick of glaring LED's used in most electronics you'll love this Fosi TB 10 D amp.

audiophile,"I want to do some experimentations. Currently use a tube amp as my headphone amp. Many people use it as pre-amp of a SS amp. I know about tube buffers, which are tube amps without headphone output, but RCA or XLR outputs, made specifically for use as pre-amps.

If I get some SS amp, could I use my tube amp headphone port without issue or is it better to buy a tube buffer?

In case of some risk involved, it's only on the unbalanced output, only on the balanced one or on both?"
audiophile,"Surely I‚Äôm missing something or some component is completely off. 

I recently finished some replica JBl 4345‚Äôs.  I duplicated the original crossovers via loudspeakerchef on eBay.  My dad always had Jbl gear so I have an affinity for it. 

I thought it‚Äôd be neat to go for a full active setup. I got myself some Jbl CSA2120Z‚Äôs, a Dayton dsp to act as the crossover.  I pulled the crossovers out of the cabinets. Wired up my own cables to carry 4 channels to each speaker via some neutrik 8-pole connectors. Everything seems to work well.  The Dayton dsp kind of sucks given some of its quirks, but it does work.

My previous setup was the same speakers with a McIntosh MA5200 and nothing else. It was driving them amazingly. The bass hit hard, clarity was great. Mids and highs were great. 

Now that it‚Äôs a fully active setup the bass seems weak.  The highs seem way too bright. Just not happy with it. It used to ‚Äújust work‚Äù, and I thought I could do even better.  Now I find myself tinkering with all the various settings on the amps on a per song basis and still not being happy with it. 

Does anyone have any suggestions?

*note: the plasma racks are there because I like to play with the effects, and the tube is mesmerizing. Turning them off becomes a pass-thru and has the same results described above."
audiophile,"Hey folks. Can anyone recommend any brands or models of car speaker systems that are actually good?

audiophile,"Hello all. I'm new here although I've been reading for a long while. First off I would like to apologize if this is a poor or redundant question. Having said that, I'm currently in the process of replacing a sound bar with a powered sub. The sound bar replaced a 5 channel surround 5 years ago because my wife was tired of the speaker wires looking ugly on the walls. I've decided within the past year or so to replace the sound bar/sub with something nicer.

This will be in my main living room. The room is about 30'x40'. I'll be using the audio system for 70/30 music/TV. I already have a pair of Polk es50's. I plan on getting a powered sub. The only other speaker I would consider adding in the near future is the matching Polk center.

My question is, should I get a new as501 and forget about the center or should I buy a used Rx-v1400 knowing I'll never use the surround channels due to the speaker wire visibility issues? I really like the yamaha amps but I'm honestly a little lost in the details of all this. Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance for any replies."
audiophile,"I have a late 80's Yamaha a-27 300w amplifier/reciever with two 2ch speaker outputs (A &amp; B) and no dedicated subwoofer outputs. Speaker output A is currently connected to a pair of Klipsch R-41m passive 8 ohm speakers. I want to add in a subwoofer.

 My understanding is that I can connect a sub with a ""High Speaker Input"" to the Speaker B output on the reciever. I get confused once we get to min speaker ohm rating...

The reciever is labeled:
   A OR B 8-16 OHM / SPEAKER
   A + B OHM MIN / SPEAKER

I want to run A and B at the same time, so does that mean all speakers in the group need to be 16 ohm? What does this mean for me? Can I even add a sub to this system? What do I need to look for?"

audiophile,"Hi, good people of Reddit,  
For the past week, I have been looking for resources and forum posts regarding the difference between studio monitors and hi-fi systems. Unfortunately, since those mentioned above are not in the same category, there were very few comments/videos comparing them.   
I just got Topping D3X Pro+, WIreworld Oasis 7 RCA cables and KRK ROKIT 5 G3 and was wondering what would be the difference if I swapped these monitor speakers for the Dali Spector 2 or Wharfedale Diamond 12.1.  
In your own words, no matter if you have compared these exact same speakers or not, what is the general sound difference between monitors and hi-fi? I must point out that I want NICE-sounding speakers as the main point.   
As some of you probably already know, the whole G3 line of KRK speakers is considered more of a  
""hi-fi studio speakers"" than truly a reference one (because of the increased bass as well as a little bit in a treble.   
If I was free to use some ""fancy"" terms as a total amateur I would say I want precise, detailed, warm, well-rounded expensive-sounding hi-fi speakers. Does Dali or Wharfedale offer that, and should I consider changing it at all? Thanks a bunch!"

audiophile,"I‚Äôll probably catch some blowback but I‚Äôll take my chances as my wife has heard enough. I have an NAD C658 preamp. I love it BUT‚Ä¶about six months ago I blew a woofer because I somehow accidentally set the volume control to MAX while using the BluOS app.

I really wasn‚Äôt sure how it happened but I blamed myself rather than the equipment. I figured I was fairly new to the phone app and just got a little loosey-goosey with my taps. Live and learn. I replaced the woofer in my Energy 22 Connoisseur and I decided that going forward I would just have to make sure that I was exceptionally careful when using the app.

I did do some research to see if there was any sort of volume limiting functions to avoid a repeat. Didn‚Äôt take long to see others complaining about the same issue and the lack of ability to set volume limits. Again, I decided that simply being cautious going forward would be enough to my ears and my speakers safe.

WRONG! About 30 minutes ago I‚Äôm watching a Youtube video on guitarist Yvette Young of the band Covet. That leads me to a video of a live performance by the band that sounded nice on my TV. ‚ÄúMan, this would sound so much better through the stereo.‚ÄùSwitch the TV audio output. Turn on the amp and preamp. Fire up the BluOS app in my phone but it won‚Äôt connect because my phone is disconnected from wifi. Connect phone to wifi and‚Ä¶KABLOOEY! Dogs are bolting, wife is screaming, daughter is running in from her room (I swear, none of this is even a slight exaggeration)as I panic mash my phone for 5 seconds in an attempt to silence the mellow sounds of Covet at +12 dB. 

Both of my woofers are blown. Not sure about the tweeters which are far more rare and costly in my particular speakers. 

So, this time‚Ä¶I‚Äôm upset with NAD or BlueOS or Covet. Somehow though, I‚Äôm mostly mad at myself. The whole fool me once/twice thing is ringing in my ringing ears.

Now if you‚Äôll excuse me I‚Äôve got a strongly worded letter to write.

audiophile,"Hi all,

I'm building a kitchen extension and plan on having 2 zones of 2 pairs of ceiling speakers.(4 speakers in total).

I was thinking four Fyne Audio FA502iC In-ceiling Speakers. https://www.fyneaudio.com/product/fa502ic/They are ¬£250 each.

I am speaking to my audio shop and they are recommending the Kef ci200qr. https://uk.kef.com/products/ci200qr They are ¬£340 each. They say they are worth it as the Kefs use the same Uni Q driver found in their reference hi-fi kit and they find the sound dispersion on them to be second to none.

He also said that if I listen to electronic music (which I do) I should get a sub as the Kefs do go low but probably not low enough for electronic music.

I'm a bit confused. So any thoughts welcome. I could spend the extra on the Kef but am unsure whether it's worth the additional ¬£360+. 

They also recommend the following speaker cable: SCP 16/4 SPEAKER CABLE OFC DCA RATED ORANGE JACKET 152M

- I need a Sub for a 2.1 setup in the living room and I am trying to decide which Subwoofer would work best. We watch a lot of TV and movies, and also plan on listening to a good amount of music.

**Current setup:**

- Triangle Borea BR03 Speakers
- Denon PMA-600NE receiver
- Fluance RT82 turntable.

***Possible Subwoofers:***

- RSL Speedwoofer 10S MKII
- SVS SB-1000 (or it's newer ""Pro"" model)
- SVS PB-1000 (or it's newer ""Pro"" model). 

Note: I'm open to other products with a similar value/price range. Our receiver has a single Subwoofer pre-out, so we will likely stick to a single subwoofer for quite some time.

-

**The Space:**

- See floor plan image here: https://i.imgur.com/OnDC8t8.jpg

- The living room is around 14' x 15' and the ceilings are 9' tall. The sitting area is about 10 feet away from the TV/Speakers, and the couch flush against the back wall and 3.5' tall kitchen divider wall.

- The house is an open floor plan, and although the distance from speaker to listener is only 10', the room opens on quite far on either side.

- I don't seem to have many position options for the subwoofer. Pretty much only on either side of the TV stand next to one of the bookshelf speakers. 

---
Which Subwoofer would you choose? 

I know speaker/sub positioning and room acoustics are vital, but I don't have much flexibility there. I'd like to hear from folks who have been through this before with similar arrangements and floor plans.

Thanks!"
audiophile,"I want to buy the 80ohm version of the berydynamic dt990 pros but im not sure if i need an amp or dac. My motherboard is the msi mag z690 tomahawk wifi.

audiophile,"Hi, 

I have the old problem of annoying my neighbors with my speakers (especially my subwoofer).   
I try to understand why sound absorption panels do little to prevent the sound from leaving my room. I understand that their role is to absorb the sound to eliminate reverb for example. 

I don't understand what's happening with the sound after it gets absorbed by such a panel (e.g. Basotect G+). I was thinking most of the sound waves get converted into heat and vibrations within the absorption panel. 

Can someone tell me what am I missing? Thanks in advance"

audiophile,"Hi all

I‚Äôve got around 150-200 max budget. I wanted to replace my current sound system which good but has too much wiring. I would like suggestions on sound systems that have minimal wiring or have  Bluetooth. This would be for my PC set up. I was considering a sound bar but anything that has good quality/price ratio would be great. Prefer ones with clear base. Also would prefer if the sub was wirelessly connected. 

Thanks!!"
audiophile,"I'm not really one of those people where ""I gotta listen to how the song was intended to sound"" Like example : I really don't care if I play a modern headset on a 1982 soundtrack, I don't have to have a pair of headphones from that era to enjoy the sound. 

But I was really curious, is there a benefit to buying older gear? I've seen some people on the audiophile discord try to recreate 70s setups which look insane and sound great. But I'm wondering if its just people blinded by nostalgia or people fascinated by that time period ect."

audiophile,"Hi, I'm looking for some advice on issues with noise with a new subwoofer that I bought recently.

I bought a Presonus Eris Sub8 and added it to my current desktop setup. Previously I was using a Pair of Presonus Eris 3.5 Speakers.

The issue is that if I connect my setup (PC -&gt; subwoofer -&gt; speakers), I pick up a lot of noise which all seem specific to my desktop machine. The noise seems dependent on load, i.e. if the machine draws more power, I'll hear different patterns and I also hear stuff when moving my wireless mouse etc.

What I tried so far:

\- Connecting my setup to a notebook, running on battery: no issues at all

\- Connecting my setup to a notebook charging through the same power socket: no issues at all

\- Connecting my setup to my desktop machine with the same power socket - noisy

\- Connecting my setup to my desktop machine with a different power socket from the same room - unbearable howling sounds

\- Also activated built-in LPF on the subwoofer, didn't do anything (didn't expect it to)

Interestingly, the issue only occurs with my subwoofer. If I use the current setup with the subwoofer powered off (using it just as a pass-through), everything is fine, so only the subwoofer seems to pick up the noise.

I'm a total noob when it comes to audio stuff and my desktop machine is built accordingly. I'm not sure if it's an issue with wiring of if this is simply a issue of the mainboard quality/shielding. What kind of wiring patterns should I avoid? Should I be looking for audio cards or audio interfaces? Never owned anything like that so all advice is much appreciated."

audiophile,"So I would like to get back into buying and collecting CDs rather than going the streaming route for my primary content.  I have read that no matter how high-quality the streaming service content, it will never be as good sounding as a CD.  So that is one reason.

Another reason is because I'd like to collect the album art/inserts that contain information that may not be available in the info sections of digital versions.

That said, I've heard that even with perfectly cared for CD collections, it's possible for the content on the CD to deteriorate over time, and you can possibly lose the data over the years.

To help deal with that possibility, rather than just burn copies of the CDs, would ripping them and storing them be the solution?  If so, would doing so lead to inferior sound quality copies, or would they be identical sound quality wise?

Thanks in advance!"

I am a music producer, i have used the m50xs for a couple of years and my mixes sound so bad. I mix to what I think sounds good in them, and it sound terrible on every other speaker.

anyways, the 770s and TYGR 300R are what i think ive landed on from my research.

Does anyone have any opinions on these? comfort is a big thing for me. I had to get replacement pads for my m50xs since my ears touched the speaker drivers and it was unbearable.

also having a flat frequency response is very important since I am mainly using these for mixing music.

Just a short noob question for y'all. Recently the end of one of the satellite speakers on my Harman Kardon surround sound broke off. The cables are copper with a silver ending.

I've got the WIMM Mini optical out attached to OPT2 of the AVR, and the AVR properly assigned that input to ""Media Player"".  The AVR recognizes the signal and switches to 'Media Player'... but I get no sound.

audiophile," 

Hello, I'm thinking about buying a Warm Audio WA-8000 (for rap vocals), I will be pairing it with a Motu M2 and possibly a Presonus Blue Tube DP V2 Preamp. My question is, is this preamp worth it? I've heard its tube mode is trash and not worth it, so I would probably be using it in solid state mode. I also thought about buying an ART tps II, as I think going for that sorta sound could be beneficial (but it is a bit more expensive where I live, so I would need a good reason), my rapping style is currently a bit slower and pronounced, it would benefit A LOT from the crispiness offered by the WA-8000. I've found myself inspired by Drake's vocal chain (although I don't sound entirely like him luckily) on Rich Flex, Jimmy Cooks and Laugh Now Cry Later. It definitely sounds like he uses the Sony C-800g on those, as when I listen to recordings of it and the WA-8000, I get hints of that crispiness that I've been dreaming of for the past couple months.

Also, for this sort of condenser mic, how powerful of a preamp do I really need? I can mostly find info on the SM7b, and even a simple cloudlifter makes a HUGE difference on that one. Thanks in advance."
audiophile,"My husband and I still have most of our highschool/college CD collection (long live Grunge) even though pretty much everything was ripped to play on our computers/phones ages ago. My 15 yo is fascinated by our physical collection though and we thought we would get him a small portable CD player to experience the music the way we did when we were teens. We don't want to spend a ton as he may quickly decide that CD players are too finicky for the trouble. I was wondering if you guys had an old favorite from back in the day that we could pick up on eBay, y'know, to double down on the nostalgia of it all."

audiophile,"By way of background, I upgraded from an Ortofon Concorde Mix to a 2M Bronze earlier this year as I am not currently DJing with vinyl and mostly listening to and/or archiving records. To be honest there was nothing 'wrong' with the Concorde but I was slightly concerned by the high tracking force, which is now unnecessary since I don't DJ, and I guess I just wanted to test the difference between a DJ and a more hi-fi cart.

The other day I re-archived a record I had previously done with the Concorde and compared the two recordings side by side. I was somewhat surprised to hear that the Concorde had noticeably more 'airy' and distinguished highs (hi hats and cymbals) vs. the Bronze. The Bronze admittedly sounded a bit warmer and less clinical but to my ears the high frequencies seemed to be muffled, almost as if there was a low pass filter applied. Nothing else in the setup apart from the cart has changed.

Clearly this is all very subjective but I wanted to get a second opinion on this and maybe any advice on what I could change with my current setup. Speaking of which, my current recording chain is:

Technics 1210Mk5 &gt; Ortofon 2M Bronze &gt; Traktor Z2 mixer (with built in audio interface) &gt; record into Audacity. I appreciate that the built in DJ mixer pre amp is potentially a weak link here but I don't think it should be relevant in this A/B comparison of two carts (happy to be corrected on this).

The Bronze was installed using the Technics overhang gauge and I used one of those little alignment block for setting the VTA. Tracking force is at 1.5g, which is recommended by Ortofon. Perhaps the much lower tracking force is the culprit here (the Concorde needs 3.0g)?

Here are two clips comparing the recordings made using these two carts: [https://soundcloud.com/insiderfm/sets/cart-comparison/s-YXNgasien71?si=23571f04f4944ba6bc06c19ef0e4dcb4](https://soundcloud.com/insiderfm/sets/cart-comparison/s-YXNgasien71?si=23571f04f4944ba6bc06c19ef0e4dcb4&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing)

audiophile,"Hey everybody, 

I‚Äôm hoping to put together a brand new setup in my office and am starting from scratch. I looked through existing posts but can‚Äôt seem to find one where somebody has the same requirements. 

My requirements are:

1. I want two nice classic looking speakers (I really like the look of Yamaha HS8 or some of the Polk monitors) that I can put on each side of my desk. I don‚Äôt know if they should be active or passive. 

2. I want to be able to connect my MacBook to play music from there, but also a vinyl player as I have a growing collection I can‚Äôt enjoy. 

3. I can‚Äôt seem to get a definite answer on the best amp for this setup (I like the small amps with tubes) but the amount of mixed feedback on brand and combination (power amp and passive speakers vs pre amp and active speakers) has me overwhelmed. 

I‚Äôm not too concerned about budget. But more importantly want to get something that sounds great for a medium/small room. 

Any thoughts?"
audiophile,"Hi all. I guess this may not exactly qualify as audiophile worthy, but I‚Äôm not exactly sure how big the plate size on a speaker stand needs to be. Not the base size but the top plate that is directly underneath the speaker.  Actually, this is for an Emotiva C1 center channel. I‚Äôm in Japan and there are limited options here for center channel stands. So the main questions:

Does the plate underneath the speaker need to be larger or the same size as the speaker footprint? 

Can I use two smaller stands to put the center on, where only perhaps 25% of the speakers surface is actually touching the plate, with the rest of the speaker ‚Äúhanging off‚Äù?

Any advice on this would be appreciated!"

audiophile," 

Well,  to make a long story long. I had a Denon TT that I got around 1985,  maybe a DP-47, with a Grado cart. Several years ago, when I went to  replace the cartridge with the Shure M97xE I had just bought, I broke  the connector off the arm wiring, so instead of messing with it, since  it was 25 or 30 years old, I got a new Pro-Ject Debut III. I used the  Shure in the Debut, and it served well and sounded much better than the  OM5E it came with.

Fast forward a  few years. Seeking to improve the sound, I got the Jico SAS/B stylus for  the Shure. It made a significant improvement. But, I became frustrated  with the Pro-Ject with hum issues. Enter the P3 which the local shop  only stocked with the Elys2 cart. Preferring to purchase locally (and  they took my Debut as trade-in), I got the P3 with the Elys2, as they  didn‚Äôt stock it without a cart.

Finally,  to my point: today I swapped the M97xE w/Jico SAS/B into the P3. Before  doing so, I played a side of a brand new MoFi GD American Beauty  (analog &gt;analog) with the Elys2. I replayed after the swap with the  M97 and WOW, HOLY SHIT, WHERE HAVE I BEEN?.  Instruments are in  separate, distinct places, side to side, front to back; voices are  present up front, not back in the crowd. I hear vibrations of the bass  strings. I want to listen to all of my records again. This may take a  while.

My partner listens to a lot of good music, including plenty of vinyl (like myself) so I wanted to gift her an upgrade for Christmas. Originally I was going to go for high end headphones (I rock Hifiman Sundaras myself - she uses basic Bose and considers them very good) but her usability criteria was too narrow (had to be wireless Bluetooth and absolutely had to be over the ear - no on ear, no wires, and has to withstand long hours of outdoor labor).

So instead I opted for speakers.

Her setup was inherited from her grandma and everything is honestly pretty choice (from what I gather - despite or because of it's age)...except her speakers. We listened to some Steely Dan on them and they sounded pretty good but not stellar. And since then the right speaker broke.

Here's the problem: with a $500 budget I was sold on a pair of marked down KEF Q350s.

She currently has early 80s Advent bookshelf speakers. One is busted.

I tried the KEFs out in the store and they sounded great! Not amazing but definitely better than her old (pre broken) Advents or the Paradigms I have at home. And the reviews online are great! A no brainer.

audiophile,"I was able to listen to the denefrips ares II DAC in my system over the past few days. The following is my take away.

It is as good as all the reviews state. The richness it brings to tone and timbre is wonderful and pleasing to listen to. R2R gets rid of what I'm going to call digital glare so common in chip based dacs. It makes everything sound much more natural. The soundstage and imaging is just as good as my Geshelli labs JNOG DAC, but the ares II can go slightly wider and deeper in the soundstage. This is a small difference but noticeable. Imaging is fantastic on both. 

The biggest difference between the two dacs for me is in the presentation of the bass. The ares II has much more detail and integrates my bookshelf speakers with the subwoofer so much better. Listening to pillar I by Andy Akiho there is a concert bass drum that when played through the ares II sounds so much more detailed and lifelike than through the JNOG. It's a big difference! So much so that up until this point I thought I would need to change out my subwoofer to get that kind of detail. Not so with this DAC in place which is great! How much better would it sound with a reference level subwoofer....? 

Another difference is in the high frequencies. The ares II is slightly rolled off which I wish wasn't the case. I know there is more information there in the song that isn't being played. Let me make it clear though that it sounds so natural and unforced that you don't care. The music just flows so easily. The JNOG has far more presence, air and ambiance; but at the cost of some glare and treble that can seem bright at times and makes itself known more often than I would like. 

The JNOGs overall presentation leans towards the mids and highs. With less focus on the lower frequencies. Which emphasizes the highs because the bass isn't there to balance things out like with the ares II. 
The ares II is richer, fuller and a little more relaxed. By relaxed I mean there is a slight softness to the defined edges of instruments, vocals, etc. Whereas the JNOG is very defined and slightly more forward/energetic, edgy with it's delivery of everything. The softness is good and bad depending on what your preferences are. 
On one hand the softness gives the illusion of less detail and separation between instruments; but on the other hand it's easier to listen to. The JNOG allows you to hear more defined instruments, vocals, details, etc but at the cost of being a bit edgy and bright. 
When watching tv and movies with the JNOG a cup being set on a table, the rustling of leaves in the wind, the clanking of chains on a purse; all these details are easily heard and distinct. Its really cool! The ares II can't do that. It is much more relaxed in its presentation, you still hear these sounds but the details don't call attention to themselves. Personally I'd like to find a DAC that can split the middle between both. 

Neither DAC is perfect but I now know I definitely want an R2R DAC in my system. I was worried that it would be to smooth and not pair well with tubes. I'm glad I can put that notion to rest. I think with an R2R DAC I'll be able to use the silver cables for extra detail and separation without having to worry about the brightness being an issue like with the chip based dac. 

I want to give a shout out to the Geshelli labs JNOG DAC. For $250 it's an outright steal. Considering the ares II is $850 and the JNOG can do 85-90% of what the ares II does is remarkable. 

Well that's about it, hope you all enjoy this comparison. Cheers and happy listening!"

audiophile,"Thought it about time I shared my modest system (description in picture captions). I think the combination of the CXA 60 and the Lumina are a good pairing. I have had the Lumina‚Äôs for a couple of months now and must say they keep impressing every time I listen to them. For being a smallish book shelf speaker they have a good deal of low end thump, in my small listening space. My audio journey started back in middle school(approximately 1970). I was listening on what I thought was a good sounding stereo, Magnavox I think it was. Then in high school stepped up to a ‚Äú real‚Äù system comprised of a Marantz 2220B receiver, Pioneer PL12 turntable and a pair of ESS bookshelf loudspeakers. I had that system till my mid 20‚Äôs and then in ‚Äò80 got the itch to get something more up to date. That system consisted a Hartman Kardon HK 570i receiver, JVC QL-A7 w/ Stanton 881S and Polk Monitor 5 loudspeakers. Then came my present wife and the children followed, so had to put the upgrades on pause for a good long while. Did a few lateral changes to the system, but always had something to listen to. Then came retirement with no mortgage or car payments and this is where I am now. Just as with life there have been up times and down times with the journey, but on a whole its  been enjoyable and rewarding. I was lucky enough to have some good mentors along the way. I have learned a lot in this hobby and try to pass that knowledge along when the opportunity arises."
audiophile,"I have been holding onto my trusted Rogers LS5/9s for years and been unable to find a nice place to use them, but being in the UK, house space is a bit limited and they have sat unused for years.

I sold a couple of pairs of these in 2015 for ¬£750 a pair and I am looking to sell these to the same guy. But I don't know what to charge for them.

They are ex-BBC, acquired when they moved out of their old building and the workshops got rid of loads of old working equipment. I used them sparingly when I did use them. They are in good shape, but have some dings and scratches.

Does anybody have any advice on what I should charge for them? I couldn't find any completed listings on ebay UK or USA, only current ones which could be a good guide price or completely inflated."

Whilest looking around I ran in to this set, open box but brand new. Got a super deal and picked them up without auditioning and they match ridiculously good. Very detailed in high, low and mids, damn these are good.

audiophile,"Happy to share that I‚Äôm enjoying the Rose 150B after having it only a few days. 

I‚Äôm upgrading from a Bluesound 2i and the sound quality difference is night and day. Many here may be using external DACs with the Bluesound so may notice less of an enhancement, but internal DAC is far more spacious and pleasant in the 150B. 

Other quick thoughts:

-	Build quality is very good - I mean it better be for $5K, but it is as expected.
-	The display is nice, but really bright even at the lowest setting. Have some mild concern that this might be a point of failure in the future - especially with the always on display - time will tell. 
-	The touch screen is nice for people to play/browse music without needing a phone or device to do so. Very responsive and allows for all operations. 
-	Software (App) is alright - it has a lot of options and works rather well. I still wish it supported Tidal Connect, but it works alright using Rose‚Äôs app for now. 
-	Software (Device) is solid - it uses Android, which I was initially concerned about, but it seems pretty well thought out and responsive. 
-	Remote - low quality and feels like an after thought. It is connected via Bluetooth, so possibly a third party remote is the way to go. 
-	Output configuration is robust and flexible. 

Overall if you have the budget I say go for it. 

Definitely possible that a Node 2i + a great external DAC costs a third as much and sounds just as good. 

The convenience of household members being able to browse music via touchscreen and the simplicity of a single device was worth it to me. 

Hope this helps any one else on here considering the upgrade!"

audiophile,"so i wanted to upgrade my car speakers,
went to a store advisor and he asked me what im looking for

i just want to ""feel as if I'm in a live concert"" in Low Volumes

i originaly wanted to swap my front two speakers to 
Focal RSE-165

which are two component speakers. 
hies first question was if im going to hear them loud
because components are excelling in very loud volumes.

and if im not going to crank up the voluke
it would be far better to buy 4 normal speakers 
in style of

MOREL TEMPO ULTRA INTEGRA 602

as they would be far bettee if i will listen in smaller audio levels

i also never have passangers in the back so i asked him why would it matter if i have 4 or just 2 of them as no one ever seats on the back .

i also asked
shouldnt i get a tweeter or a small sub below the seat as i love bass, 
he said ill have plenty of bass and the sub woffer would be the last upgrade he is suggesting

the next one after this 4 normal speakers
would be to turn 2 of them to component ones (which i didnt understood what is to ""turn"" them into components they either are or not right?)

so in short

i need help

too much information i dont know if half of it is correct

1. is it really better to invest in 2 normal speakers then cpmponent ones if your not listening in loud volumes ?

2. is it really better to have in a car 4 good speakers rather then 2 with a small sub ?
i always thought sub was the one that gives depth

3. can you really upgrade speakers to components ?


and please
do you have any suggestions for good speakers or whatever to achieve what i wanted in the budget.of this 2 speakers i mentioned ?"

For example, right now I have beyerdynamic 250 ohms version, And I have a USBC dongle from my phone to my Aiyama H1 with upgraded op amps to muses 02. Since it's a portable amp it doesn't have a dac So I want something that just gives line out only output. It's in my understanding that my cheap USB-C dongle's DAC converts the digital signal from my phone to analogue Then it sends it to the inbuilt amp. So I think what I'm doing is double amping when I plug that source into my H1 portable amp. Is there a way to just use the DAC.

audiophile,"I know there's a *huge* controversy and discussion around Spotify introducing a lossless option. Apart from all that, how realistic is it that something is still in the works?

I recently took the online test to determine whether or not my hi-fi setup (and ears) can even discern the difference between ""high quality"" and ""lossless"". Long story short, I can. It makes a huge difference. I've been a long-time Spotify premium subscriber and have hundreds of playlists and favorites as a result. I signed up for Tidal in the interim but don't enjoy the online playlist converters and paying two bills for music. 

Tl;dr: How realistic is the hope of seeing Spotify Hi-Fi actually happen?"

audiophile,"I used Audio Out from receiver to subwoofer's LFE In. However, my subwoofer operates completely independent of my bookshelf speakers due to a lack of necessary inputs/outputs. My receiver's volume knob doesn't even have an effect on my subwoofer's volume. Any tinkering I do with the sub must come via the crossover and volume setting that is built into the subwoofer's amp, or via REW/EQAPO.

When using my old and broken receiver, I'd just measure the system at several variations within my listening position; I'd then average the measurements to a single a measurement. Finally, I took the single, averaged measurement, and EQ'd it via REW's EQ feature. Under Target Type, I told REW I was EQing the measurement from a Full Range speaker.

How would I go about measuring my setup with a subwoofer that isn't taken into account by my receiver?

Thanks for any help."
audiophile,"Hi all,

I am not extremely knowledgeable in how sound systems work, so I wanted to learn a bit from this community regarding how to approach an issue with the bass coming from my neighbor's apartment. My main problem is that I am getting hit by the  bass coming from their sound system every night, and it is surprisingly very disturbing. The main issue is that it is not just when they are watching a movie on the weekend or listening to music, but every night when they are just watching random TV it is happening, sometimes until 11 or 12.

My question is what would this community deem a reasonable ""ask""? My feeling is that if you are just watching TV, there is not really any need for bass and the bass portion of the sound system should just be shut off. However, I don't even know if that is something that is possible with all sound systems, or if people who appreciate the finer sounds in life would deem that too demanding of a request.

When I initially brought it up, my neighbor followed up by saying that he went into the sound settings and that it was already ""set to a neutral balance that isn't bass forward"".  I want to respect their enjoyment of their space, but I would also like them to respect my desire to enjoy my space, so just trying to figure out how to proceed from here and what would be an appropriate request.

Much appreciated!"

But here my question and asking for advise. When I go to my speakers properties, in enhancements when i turn ON ""Loud Equalization"" my movies, shows, anime become louder and more clear, But at the same time it makes spotify music really quie. Then vise versa, when I turn OFF Loud Equalization I would need to lower the volume or else spotify would be extremely loud, and my shows would be really quiet even if my speakers are at level 25. 

Is there a way that i can set spotify and everything else that has sound the same? Spoitfy is the ONLY app that the odd ball, and having to keep turning on and off loud equalization is getting annoying."

audiophile," I have owned them for over a year now and they have blown me away with their sound stage, clarity and imaging, they are easy to run 250 ohms so having youtube on 100% and volume mixer on 40 is loud enough with very little reduction in sound quality, really hard to tell if there is any at all.

All that being said I have read that ''amps can open up the sound more and adds to the overall dynamics of the sound allowing the headphones to be driven with more power and clarity''. But I am skeptical since mine already sound as good as I would think they could sound, it¬¥s like i'm refusing to believe that an amp could possibly make them sound any better. Any opinions?

audiophile,"I am close to deciding on my first real hi-fi system. It includes a [Buchardt i150 amp](https://buchardtaudio.com/collections/accessories/products/i150-integrated-amplifier) and a pair of [Buchardt S400 MKII](https://buchardtaudio.com/collections/passive-speakers/products/s400-mkii?variant=42420049608961). I asked the rep at Buchardt what they recommended for cables and this was their reply:

‚ÄúFor cables, we usually recommend starting out with something basic, or just keeping what you already have, and then waiting with changing cables till you know the sound of the system well. If you change cables while also changing other components, it can be hard to judge if the cables give you what you are looking for, and therefore are worth their price. So we recommend just getting something that is fairly basic, is decently built and has good connection to the speakers. There are many options here, and going with any of the larger brands, like Supra, Audio Quest and QED should ensure that you get something reliable. But again, there are many great brands out there, and even most ""no name"" cables will do fine as a starting point.‚Äù

I‚Äôve really nothing to compare good or bad cables and would I even recognize the difference? Likely doubtful. To date I‚Äôve been using a Burson Conductor 3XR headphone amp out to a pair of M-Audio BX8 using just some XLR cables I bought off Amazon. They sound fine to me but again, I‚Äôve nothing to compare it to. So would you agree with the reps response above and should I look at those brands? I don‚Äôt want to cheap out but at the same time, I‚Äôm 58 years old and I don‚Äôt even know if my hearing would detect the differences between cables. it has less to do with money and more to do with functionality. I don‚Äôt need the best. I just want them to work well. All opinions appreciated."
audiophile,"Hey everyone, I've been wondering about some pa systems and their ability to play music really loudly, but still allow for conversation to happen without shouting or straining your voice. Some examples that come to mind are Void Acoustics, Funktion 1s, D&amp;B and even JBL if set up well.

Given that there is a set up element that appears to be involved (particularly present with some of the slightly middle end pa systems) my assumption has been that this has been due to good crossover configuration and clean separation across drivers and frequencies that prevent too much saturation in the frequency range where voices typically sit. Is this assumption correct? Or are there pieces to this puzzle that I'm missing?

Perhaps this is more a DIY Audio piece as its straying, but I'm looking to build some  PA speakers that will primarily be for dub/ambient in a smallish room (around 30-40sqm) with loads of cushions, couches, carpets etc. The primary goal will be for clear texture from the speaker that allows for musical engagement but also facilitates easy conversation between people. So I have been wondering if there are deliberate steps to follow to end up with this result.

Thanks"
audiophile,"I got the silver WF-1000XM4 back in Oct 2021 from Sony Philippines which [I promptly reviewed](https://youtu.be/Pfyd3uNu4r4). Less than a year later in June, the left earbud died without a warning, so I sent it to Sony for repairs.

After a few months they [replaced the left bud](https://youtu.be/PiaTUVOt7uI), and I immediately noticed a weird, faint sound the moment I started using it. Like, I literally heard it while I was still inside the repair center. I wasn't sure what to make of it back then, so I dimissed it thinking it must have been my imagination or that it was coming from the source audio.

So I went home and used it for a week, updated the firmware and tried different settings. However, the sound was still there. It was most noticeable whenever I was talking while making a call.

Finally I could not take it anymore. Now that I know what to listen for, I started hearing it all the time and I could not ignore it. Went online and did some research. Found one Reddit thread and a post on the Sony forums. It really helped because it was then that I realized that 1) It was a common problem so I was not going crazy and 2) It could easily be replicated by snapping your jaw.

[Returned to the Sony service center](https://youtu.be/C-HHeATZUzw) where the technician initially tried to convince me that it was ""normal"" until I asked for a reference pair. They had this black unit and when I tried it, the sound was still there - only much fainter. I spent a really long time teaching the the technician to replicate it by snapping his jaw with my silver bud, and then with the black one.

They offered to replace the left earbud with another one coming from another silver unit. However, that bud also exhibited the same artifact. As expected they tried to convince me that this was normal, but I [held my ground](https://youtu.be/8MoehJjCN00) and asked them to please connect with a product expert at Sony, and that I am very open to having a dialogue with them regarding this issue.

So I went home without my buds until the other day where the center messaged me saying that Sony Philippines got back to them saying that the sound was ""normal"" and that they were trying something with a new software update. I challenged this by replying 1) If it were normal, how come the sound coming from the black unit was not as loud? and 2) If it were a software/firmware issue, how come the feedback happens even if the buds were off?

The biggest challenge here is that I do not know of a way to capture / record the phantom ringing / feedback sound since it's very faint, like it is coming from the driver itself.

If I take it back, I will not be using it because the sound really bothers me. I have many other TWS but the WTF-1000XM4 was my personal favorite because of the fitting and sound quality. It will end up collecting dust in my cabinet.

What do you suggest? Have you experienced something similar and if so, can you share your story for Sony to see?"

audiophile,"Hi guys, I need some help sorting my mind. I‚Äôm coming from a basic 2.1 setup, which I was running the last ten years or so. Marantz AV, with bookshelves and a sub from german Nubert. Nothing audiophile grade but pretty fun to listen to. 
But I always wanted to step up, get better, closer to the real sound.
So I ordered myself some Buchards S400 MkII. 
First impression was wowsers and even my wife thought they fit the living room very nice. Jackpot! 
But then came the pain. My wife started wearing ear protection, I was still in denial. But soon thereafter I had to realize that even my ears were fatigued as hell. 
That was a month ago and it‚Äôs been a mad house since that. I‚Äôve been experimenting with all kinds of stuff since that. First I blamed the room. L-shape, hard wooden walls and ceiling, not the best circumstances. So I softened the room up, covered the walls with blankets but it didn‚Äôt help. Bought a different amp, lyngdorf tdai-1120 did not help. 
All right, new speakers than, Nubert worked the last time. I gave the Nuvero 60 a Go, ordered them with a bluesound powernode, pretty much with the same result.
My ears can cope with low volumes and more ambient genres. But higher volumes and guitars are killing us.

I also get a small buzz from the studio monitors even when the PC is idle, which I don't get when I connect the USB soundcard to my laptop. What could be the case? Is there something I can fix within my PC? The gpu is rtx 3070 from Asus.

Thanks for every help guys."

audiophile,"Hi, Recently I have upgraded to a standalone dac and am currently using Chromecast audio to stream optical into that. When its working it works pretty well. 
Sadly these days Cromecast audio support is going downhill. And my stream keeps cutting out quite regularly. Being quite done with this I am now looking for a new streamer. Ideally one with as little extra‚Äôs as necessary (hoping to spare some cash), so I wont be needing a dac. Additionally I would like to not use my phone during music time, so it would be great if the streamer has a screen and interface to select and control the music. I have been looking for this for a while now, but I see so many new options popping up here and am a little lost in the woods.I thought i‚Äôd dedicate this thread to it. 
Does anybody here have any ideas of a suitable streamer for me?"
audiophile,"This is the only listing I can find with these particular speakers, so I'm having trouble basing it off of something else. This isn't my listing, just wondering if they are actually worth that much. Any help would be appreciated!"
audiophile,"I'm not an ""Audiophile"" but I love music and I want to enjoy it as much as possible. My first setup was a pair of Yamaha NS-777 and a 5.1 surround system connected to a Pioneer A/V Receiver (don't remember the exact model)

Now I've moved to Canada and after a year of working here, I want to build a setup to listen to music. My budget is around 3K CAD and maybe I can go a little higher.

I found a shop here and went to listen. They didn't have the brands that I've heard from and known but I kind of liked the Paradigm Monitor SE 3000F out of the bunch they had. I don't think there's a shop nearby that has other brands so I should either buy that one or put my faith in online reviews.

What would you recommend me to do? My end goal is to have a Dolby Atmos or at the very least 7.2 system. But since my budget is limited, I thought I'd go with a 2 channel first, then add the rest later on.

The current recommendation is this:

Speakers: Paradigm Monitor SE 3000F (around 680 CAD for a pair)

SUB: Paradigm Defiance V10 (780 CAD)

A/V Receiver: Marantz Cinema 70s (1600 CAD)"

audiophile,"Virtually all new pop/rock CD (or other digital format) releases since the mid 1990s use dynamic compression in order to make the recording sound louder. Most newer digital releases as a result sound quite overblown and in some cases distorted compared to CDs that were mastered during the 1980s and early 1990s, even though they are often about an average of 8-10dB louder. Open up a track from a 1980s CD in Audacity and you will almost certainly see a dynamic waveform that looks very similar to that of an old LP. By comparison, if you open up a track from a CD released in the last 20 years, you will most likely see an undynamic block of audio that is very difficult to differentiate different segments of. A 1980s CD typically has an average dynamic range score of 12-15, whereas many CDs being released today have scores of just 4-6. There are certain newer CDs that make a big deal out of being recorded on analog equipment, and yet the CD edition still suffers from excessive digital compression at the mastering stage. In many cases this compression seems to be absent on the vinyl editions of newer albums, which makes me question why they can't use the vinyl master for CDs like many CDs did during the 1980s - a lot of them were quite bright but I personally quite like the way old CDs sound.

What makes little sense to me is why this dynamic compression caught on so quickly in the early-mid 1990s if it affects the sound quality of releases. In 1991 virtually nothing (with a very small number of exceptions) was using brickwall compression at the mastering stage, yet just 4 years later (1995) it seems as though about 90% of new releases were having this done to them. I would have said that 1992 was the year when brickwall compression began to be used, but it took another couple of years for it to really catch on with the majority of new releases."
audiophile,"Hi, looking to get this amp and wondering if anyone had any thoughts on it. Also is it powerful enough to run a pair of Triangle Borea BR08s? Many thanks."
audiophile,"Alright guys, this might be a long one. But here's the deal, I live in Chile, that really shortens the amount of choices of amps, speakers, turntables, etc. And also means that there's not much people to ask to, so I hoping for help here. 

Let me describe you my setup. Since always I've been using and old 90s radio my father bought decades ago. I used the record player that came with it as well as a cd player. In time I have upgraded into a atlpx120 and most of the time I listen with my FiiO M6, through line out, to hi res files or use it to stream for comfort. I've been feeling like I want more, besides, the radio has an issue, the right side speaker inputs where the wire cables go, seem to be a bit broken, and randomly disconnects. 

Looking at the radio, the speakers, do you think it is worth buying an amp, say like cambridge axa25-35 (something in that price range) or with this speakers it is not worth it? Should I aim for better speakers? I'd thank any advice or maybe tell me your experiences if you like to! Have a good one

audiophile,"I am a student and live with my parents, in our houses attic. This is a good thing most of the time, as I have lots of space, but it also means that I only have one flat wall which is mostly taken up by wardrobes and cabinets.

Because of this, my setup (as well as my TV) is basically in the middle of the room, my bed being directly behind it and my couch about 3-4 meters away. Behind my couch is a drumset and a bit more space, which isn't really usable because of the angle.

I have Ecouton Audiolabor LQL 70, a Thorens turntable, a phono preamp and a Rotel amplifier. I use the preamp because the Rotel constantly gets louder and more silent every few minutes on the phono channel. I can post further details on the setup later, as I'm not home right now.

audiophile,"Hey all. Assembling first home theater system and before finalizing everything, wanted to see if there were any pairing conflicts with the following cobbled-together setup and if anyone had recommendations for a center speaker to go with this:

-LG BX OLED Smart TV

-Denon S570BT AVR

-Klipsch R-100SW 10‚Äù sub

-Front: ELAC Debut 2.0 B5.2 speakers

-Rear / surround, previous homeowner installed: Polk Monitor 30 Series II speakers

-Center: TBD 

Just want to see if there‚Äôs any matching concerns and what I should look for in a center front speaker, if I need a center front speaker, if I should match said speaker to the ELACs. I‚Äôve heard horror stories about all of the ELAC center speakers so if there‚Äôs another brand I could opt for here, or any other solution, that would be great.

Another option to avoid the ELAC center would be to swap the ELAC Debuts for Emotivas Airmotiv B1+s and a C1+. I‚Äôve heard these can be more demanding on a AVR - Will a Denon S570BT drive that setup?"

audiophile,"My mom has been asking for a multi-room audio setup for a few years now.  I know of Sonos, but my folks have a very good living room receiver/surround sound setup with excellent speakers.  It seems like AudioPro might be a great option to expand upon their setup.  

I would want to add the following 

-a central unit to connect to their receiver
-a small speaker to fill the space between the living room and large dining kitchen are
-2-3 medium/large speakers to fill the dining room/kitchen-space. 
-Thinking medium satellite in kitchen, medium satellite in dining, and maybe a sub for the entire area (it‚Äôs quite large.  Estimate 600sqft.)
-Hoping to keep it around 1k.  Less is great.  

Couple questions
1.  Do I need a unit for the tv room where the receiver and surround speakers are or can they be used in tandem with the audio pros?

2. Their speakers are old but high end.  Klipsch towers, center, and surround.  I believe mom blew out back left surround.  Wondering if it this setup will be able to handle her max volume moments.

I also own a Dayton sub-1200 12inch subwoofer with frequency response of 25hz-140hz. Here is where the confusion begins. Everywhere I read says crossover should be about about 10hz above lowest hertz or the main speakers. So 30 hz? The minimum is 40 on the back of the speaker. I know this is wrong but don‚Äôt know why. Dayton manual says ideal setting is between 60-80hz which sounds good but shouldn‚Äôt this be highly dependent on range of main speakers? How does my main speakers have a lower frequency response than my sub?

audiophile,"Hi, good people of Reddit!  
I'm looking to get a concise, simple, and clear explanation for this question if possible.  


Comparing soundcards like Focusrite, Steinberg, Tascam, etc vs  
cards like Creative, Asus, Nvidia, etc.  


Besides the obvious part that the external DAWs have more ins\\outs for recording,  
it seems (in a similar price range, I know DAWs can cost 1000$s,) that the Creative and Asus cards  
offer more bang for the buck, if ONLY listening to music\\games is your hobby.  
They usually have a higher bit rate, Frequency, DB, and less noise than the professional grade ones.  


So the question is, why would I look for let's say 200$ range ""Pro"" Cards, like  Focusrite 2i2 3rd gen,  
when I get better sound quality with a card like Creative AE-7?  


Looking forward to your comments!  
Best to you all! :D"

Sennheiser HD 660S with JDS Labs Element II

I bought a B stock Element II as they are discontinued and the Element III are digital in only. Came well rated for a combo DAC and amp and gives me options for a turntable later.

Intended to use the Apple Music Hi-res lossless from my phone but clearly got the wrong adapter (wants external power even though it‚Äôs a mains desktop amp?). Being disappointed I hooked it up to the PC and bought some hi-res music. Started with the remastered OK Computer in 96/24 and was very pleased, then got the remastered Nevermind in 192/24. I was slightly worried I‚Äôd wasted my money on something like Nirvana in 192 but I‚Äôve not stopped smiling since it went on. Downloaded JRiver for WASAPI and am all around very pleased.

audiophile,"So I got a svs ultra 5.1 in July and I'm beyond satisfied with it. I know there are better sounding speakers but I don't I would be able to tell the difference. Along with the new system I got a ported 3000 sub. It's freaking huge! It sounds so much better than anything I've ever had in my house. However it leaves me wanting still. Until my current car I've had various two 12"" subs in my trunk. The 3000 just leaves me wanting more in comparison to the trunk subs. EDM is where I feel it the most, hip-hop has been just fine. Decibels + fidelity from the ultras has not been an issue at all.
Am I comparing apples to oranges? Is the ft^3 making that much of a difference? Should I be using non factory settings on the 3000?(I've been switching between music and movie presets.) Am I just romanticizing my car audio? Do I like bass too much for my own good? I've already rattled things off walls."

audiophile,"Hi all! 

I've been upgrading my components piece by piece, and I'd like y'all's help in determining whether I should upgrade my DAC. I currently play digital audio through my phone -&gt; Apple Lightning-to-3.5mm dongle. From what I've gathered, the dongle is a pretty sweet piece of kit for its $9 price. 

I did some A/B testing (as blind as one can with the pops and cracks of vinyl) between my analog and digital system and generally found the analog more pleasurable (mostly just warmer and fuller, but could be bias coming through). I'm wondering if it's now time to switch up the DAC. I've done online research but it's oftentimes difficult to know what 'professionally'-done product reviews are legit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some info about my set-up:

\- I have Magnepan 3.5r's powered by Odyssey Stratos Monoblocks in a 12'x21' furnished but untreated room. I have thick carpet for the whole floor, a full bookshelf on one of the long walls, and windows on the other long wall. The back wall is my kitchen (I have an open floorplan living room-kitchen) and so has plenty of diffusion. Corners all have some piece of furniture for diffusion. The only open, flat wall is inches behind where I sit.

\- I use a Schiit SYS for volume control. Even with the 83db sensitivity of the Maggies, I never push the SYS past 9:30 (that gets me to an average \~78 db at my listening position). I doubt I'll ever need more gain from my system. The SYS doesn't have balanced ins or outs.

\- The Stratos do have balanced inputs, so I \*might\* one day want to utilize this capability, though I'd also have to buy another preamp with balanced ins/outs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have any of you switched from the Apple dongle to another DAC? If so, were you able to hear an appreciable difference? TIA."

I work at a vintage audio store, and thus get really good deals on used speakers, and systems. Because of this I have an eclectic collection of speakers for which I love for their various strengths. At the moment I have:

Klipsch RP-150M (Really find these fatiguing, they've been banished to the bedroom as TV speakers)
B&amp;W 686 S2 (My absolute favorite, so much sound in small package)
B&amp;W DM601 (Good General Speakers)
Klipsch KG-1 (Bought for bassier notes to complement the 686s)
And for a center I have:
Paradigm CC-490 V.5 (The best Center I've ever heard)

I currently have the 686s on top of the 601s ontop of the KG-1s on Speaker stands in my living room. Along with the CC-490 in the middle. They're all hooked up to a Pioneer VSX-41 set to some processing mode called 6-Stereo.

Lately I've been feeling like my speakers aren't performing at their best. I have used all of them individually and know they all sound great, but when hooked up to the Pioneer, it feels like they've lost life. I'm thinking it's because there's some shenanigans going on in the DSP that's holding them back.

My main reason for using the sets of Bookshelf speakers instead of dedicated towers, is because my boss allows me swap out sets as I find better options. This has allowed me to fine tune my set up. I also live in an apartment so size of the receiver /amplifier set up is important, similarly heat dissipation is rather important (while tube amps are fun, the power usage isn't.)

Is there a better way to set up this system that would bring all of these speakers to life? Im not necessarily looking to get the absolute best sound, I just want to do these speakers justice. Would it be better to get dedicated Amplifiers (like an SMSL? or Dayton Audio Amp) for each section, and use a preamp and piggyback the signals to each?

Thanks for the help :)"
audiophile,"I recently bought a pair of Transparent Zeros and I think I love them more than my Emotiva home theater setup (which is also fantastic, no regrets there).
I want to lift them up off my desk but I don't like the look of most speaker stands. The T0's have a 1/4-20 threaded insert on the bottom, which can be used to mount them on camera tripods and I believe could be used on a microphone boom.
I don't listen to anything loud, I think I'm under halfway on the volume knob and even then I'll turn things down in software.

Does anyone see any problems with using a mic boom to mount these speakers? What about a desktop/mini camera tripod? Will the benefits outweigh any drawbacks?

I should mention the room is maybe 15'x20', probably less, and my desk is arranged so that I am looking into the space with a wall behind my chair. My desk is from Desk Haus and crazy heavy, no wobble whatsoever"

audiophile,"I understand this community has a particular disdain for sound bars, but from my understanding, they seem quite lucrative in the budget range and setup ease, generally speaking of course. I recently purchased the SAMSUNG HW-Q60B 3.1ch Soundbar for $120 this is originally a $500 soundbar that has stayed around the 500-upper $300 price tag. To be clear, I'm not asking on what I should purchase, as that has already been done. My friend seems to think at this price point, I could've gotten much better with bookshelf speakers. I find this hard to believe especially from what I've seen recommended as budget-tier bookshelf speaker non-powered much less with no subs am I wrong?"

audiophile,"As many of you have experienced, sometimes scrolling on the resale markets can be boring or listless or frustrating. Not yet the first week of December and I'm already out of my budget for new toys. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Two-year-old ad for a pretty nice pair of Yamaha NS-100X. Flawless grills! Very presentable. 

2) A fully functioning, but rough around the edges, Yamaha CR-820. The more desirable of the late 70s Yamaha receivers, since they used discrete transistors, lending them to easier repairs. It's a nice midweight performer (55wpc) that balances the classic 70s receiver punch and Yamaha neutrality. Two of the bulbs are out and the cabinet is a little worse for wear, but it was a nice price. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) My second-to-favorite of the bunch (the first being the bookshelves), a really clean Technics SL1700MK2, with OG box! The front and sides have some keyed-in lines, but the dust cover is intact, and all I had to do was fit in a #39 o-ring belt for the notorious cueing &amp; auto return functions. Holding speed, playing very well. My first TT with VTA adjustment."
audiophile,"I have a question on high end tt carts. Why don't ALL high end carts use microline styli? Or at least something in that vein like shibata? I'll see 4-figure carts online sometimes that will have like nude elliptical. This puzzles me because, by definition, only MicroLine can get into ALL ofnthe records grooves during playback, so if a manufacturer is already going to go all out on a state of the art cantilever and MC, why would they sacrifice tracking accuracy by using a subpar stylus shape?"
audiophile,"I've heard comments online suggesting the R200 and LS50 Meta sound very similar, with perhaps a bit of a superior mid-range, more detail, and better highs on LS50 but better bass on the R200.  I also read that the LS50 Meta would be more appropriate as near field monitors and R200 would not be as good for that application.  As for soundstage, based on what I've come across, it seems the R200 has a wider soundstage, but LS50 Meta has a deeper one?

Are all of those characterizations pretty spot on? 

The R200 are like $565/pr right now, and the LS50 Meta go on sale for about $1300.  Wait long enough and you can find places like Crutchfield do $1000/pr with stands, like they did with the LS50 years back.

So it seems like the R200 would be the best bang for the buck out of these two?  Would there be anything the LS50 Meta brings to the table over the R200 that can justify double the price?

Also, one reviewer I came across said he prefered R100 over R200, in that the R100 seemed more resolving and revealing (maybe some would define it as thinner sounding).  Would you say that going up the line from R100 to R200 to R700, you're just getting ""more"" of the same, just better?

Lastly, KEF LS50 Meta come with port plugs, for when you want to use subwoofers and not the port.  I like the idea because I personally prefer sealed speakers in the sense that I won't get bugs crawling inside of them because they are sealed.  With LS50 I can use the plugs and they are effectively sealed, and I also plan to use subs down the road.  With R200, the port has something in the middle and I'm not sure you can simply plug it?

The problem is that there isn't a really great way to co-locate the P6 near the receiver, they're likely going to be on opposite sides of the room. I have an RCA cable that'll do the distance no problem, but the SO doesn't like the wires across the floor for multiple enumerated reasons.  This leaves me looking for a wireless solution to bridge the gap.  I'm hesitant to just get a BT transmitter since it will kill (?) the quality.  Is there a HQ BT transmitter that'll do the job? A wifi alternative?  Maybe some sort of wireless DAC I can plug into the receiver? Or am I resigned to wittling my girl down by inches until she caves and lets me just put a wire runner across the floor...

audiophile,"Hey all. I'm not ripping on this beloved system. I'm just trying to see if I'm doing something wrong. 

I hooked up the Atom to some Yamaha NX-E100s which have a sensitivity rating of 87dB. I connected my phone to the system via Bluetooth and played music from Amazon Music. Those speakers are from an old Yamaha microsystem. They are not amazing, but they have always served me well. They go down to 55Hz, but connected to the Uniti Atom, it sounds like there are no frequencies below 150Hz. I also am aware that Bluetooth is not ideal. I was trying to get things connected quickly just to hear something. Since Naim doesn't support Amazon Music, I'll need to sign up for Tidal or Qobuz.

So I'm not expecting amazing right now, but what I'm hearing sounds like a powerful clock radio. Poor frequency response and tinny. I haven't heard a Naim amplifier for 20-plus years, so maybe I just don't care for their sonic signature. But people rave about the Atom and I feel like I'm missing something. I will hook up a sub and see if that helps.

* **Is this all bullshit and what is the truth?**
* When I am sitting at the desktop I am using 50% Scarlett and 20% Windows which should be around 10% total monitor volume.
* When I am working around the apartment (48 square meters) I am using 50% Scarlett and 60% Windows which should be around 30% total monitor volume.
* I never go above 30% total monitor volume, because it is perfectly loud at 30% from every corner of the apartment.

audiophile,"Here's a good example of why manuals, even for speakers, are important. 
  For nearly all speakers the rule is the pull them away from the wall and have some toe in. Toe in depends on the speakers but nearly all recommend some toe in.

These speakers, Electro Voice Interface B on the inside and Interface C on the outside, specifically require the speakers to be placed and inch or two flat to the wall. They actually sound terrible when placed conventionally. 

Amazing speakers, by the way. If you ever have a chance to grab some don't hesitate."

Recently got into vinyl and bought a pair of Audioengine bluetooth speakers for the listening space.

Aren't you putting a lot of emphasis on the last 3 feet of the power cable, but ignoring the previous 100 feet in your walls?

audiophile,"I just bought a Lenovo legion 5 pro and realized the high end is much more crisp and pronounced then on my pc. I've a/b tested it with one speaker connected to each device and confirmed it sounds a lot better. Both are using the soundcard that came with the computer, this means I need to upgrade to a better DAC for my Pc to get that higher fidelity sound right? Is a DAC the same thing as a soundcard? 

Before anyone asks I'm using exclusive mode on both devices to ensure there's no windows processing going on. So the difference seems down to the sound card."

audiophile,"Alright, so I just got into headphones. Last month i got myself an hd800s. Amazing headphones when EQd using PeaceAPO and soundstage of course sounds incredible. But I like bass, so I decided to get the th900mk2 to see if I‚Äôd like them better and we‚Äôll, yea I love it. I think I‚Äôm more of a bass head and prefer closer back cans. So now, I was thinking‚Ä¶. If I return both the hd800s and the th900mk2 I can afford a focal Stelia for around 3k. 

Would this be a good choice would you think? I like bass and primarily listen to rap, hip hop, edm etc but also rock, alt rock, underground stuff. 

I have the RME ADI-2 DAC and EQ within that now."

audiophile,"I always enjoy seeing people share their favorite material to demo with friends or new listeners.  Maybe we can share and find some new material from each other to demo.

Here is my list!

-Steely Dan / Gaucho (multichannel) great to show clarity and separation.  Always get some surprised looks when the singers start over the rear channels on Babylon sisters.  

-Pink Floyd / DSOTM (multichannel) just an immersive experience overall.  Great tracks for displaying bass extension (Time) and separation (On the Run, Brain Damage, Eclipse, Money).   

-Pink Floyd / The Later Years (The Dogs of War/Learning to Fly, One Slip) the remastering on these tracks just makes the soundstage sound absolutely massive.  

-Alice in Chains / MTV Unplugged (Would) for stereo integration.  The bass licks caterpillar along with that low thump and the acoustic guitars clear bright plucks.  Fantastic track.  

-Foreigner / Semi-Unplugged (Juke Box Hero) most haven‚Äôt heard this but it‚Äôs one of my favorites for vocals and getting a feel for how bright speakers are.  

-Rush / Moving Pictures Japan Release (Tom Sawyer, Yyz, The Camera Eye) These tracks are great percussion demo tracks.  Yyz can quickly overwhelm speakers that struggle in the midrange and subwoofers that are not tight.

-Tool / Lateralus and Fear Inoculum (The Patient, Lateralus, Chocolate Chip Trip, Invincible) Percussions.  Chocolate chip trip is a difficult track to reproduce.  Subwoofers are quickly exposed and so are sloppy midranges.  The patient is very dynamic and I enjoy hearing this in a non chaotic fashion which most speakers tend to struggle with."

audiophile,Just get an amplifier and add something like a Sonos Amp to it. It's literally a fraction of the price and you get the same results.
audiophile,"I'm trying to solve some music problems in our household and I'm kinda stuck. Here are my goals:

\- preferably, use my iTunes library as the main source for all music  
\- give my two kids the ability to play curated lists of music in their individual rooms without relying on an internet-capable device  
\- I want them to be a little more involved with music than just ""Alexa, play pop music"" so that they develop a little more of a relationship with particular artists, and I want to get the Alexa devices out of our house  
\- I'd like there to be a simple, single function screen so they can see albums, playlists, etc while making a selection  


It would be fine if there's one central place in the house where they start music from, as long as they can both listen individually to different things at the same time. It's a small house, 1100 sq ft. I don't want a smart phone involved at all. When I imagine the ideal solution using tech that USED to exist, I guess it would be two Apple iPods that we load music on and leave connected to a speaker in their room.  


What do we do?"

audiophile,"I like music. It's therapeutic. I want to listen without headphones in my new soundproof office space. But I'm a noob and need help on what to buy. 

I want something smallish that sounds great for loud music with a lot of low bass, I listen to a lot of Doom Metal, Stoner, Sludge, Death Metal. But also other genres occasionally.

I'd primarily be listening from music apps.  So I guess I need something Bluetooth. Very soon, I'd like to hook up a turntable to play vinyl. But that's not the immediate need.

I'm willing to spend a fair amount of money but not more than probably $500-600 I think. But not ruling out anything. 

The office space is only 5.5 feet wide and 10 feet long. My desk will be on the short side. A book shelf will cover the entire wall directly behind me. I could attach speakers to the cieling or walls. Or set them in the bookshelf. Or even on my desk of they were small enough. I plan to attach spund absorbing acoustic panels as needed. The walls are ""soundproof.""

Krell Pre Amp
Mark Levinson No. 27 Amp
Eminent Techilogies LFT 8 speakers

And started listening sessions for about a week. I have had this system since about 1999 and I love it.

Then the worst thing happened.. the left channel of the Mark Levinson amp broke. I get buzzing, static and hardly any sound from it. 

I opened it up and I don't see any swelling of the components. So now I am not sure what to do. Do I try to get a 23 year old Amp fixed or do I get a new one. I would get it fixed, but I am afraid that this is just the start.

If I don't get it fixed, I don't know what to get for my system.

All around i kept hearing that the cloud alphas were actually decent headphones for the price and decent ones for gaming. and i do like the sound of these a lot but i was wondering if they would sound better or not if i were to plug them into my Behringer umc-22 audio interface using a 3.5mm to 6.35mm adapter. currently they are plugged into a MSI z490-a pro motherboard so im wondering if plugging them into an audio interface is even worth it or not for these. Or should i just save doing that until i get a pair of actually good headphones"
audiophile,"Part of my dream system included stereo subs, and as a result I chose equipment that would accommodate this. But I always had this nagging suspicion that it didn‚Äôt much matter, after all bass isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdirectional‚Äù, at least in a relatively small space like a living room - and truly, it isn‚Äôt. 

While I didn‚Äôt at the time, I now understand the physics behind how long frequencies aren‚Äôt directional and how a single subwoofer can provide bass sufficient reinforcement.

A few days ago I was cleaning up my cables and neglected to turn on my left sub. Ever since I noticed that my bass was feeling thin, and no matter what I did with my crossovers, levels and EQ, I just couldn‚Äôt get it to perform like I was expecting. It just wasn‚Äôt projecting the way I was used to. It wasn‚Äôt huge, and I just summed it up to my ears not being in a mood.

But today my kids were watching Moana, and all the cinematic LFE was just missing. I cranked up the subwoofer output, and the bass stage just felt very unconvincing - like it‚Äôd get louder but never managed to fill the room - it lacked the tactile projection I was expecting.

Tonight listening to music, and definitely noticed things just felt lifeless.

Once I realized the left sub was turned off and turned it back on, the bass cues - the tactile quality, integration and punchiness just immediately spring back to life. Not only the low end specifically, but it seemed to build up contrast and timbrel context in other frequencies as well; the bass sounded more like bass instruments, not just lumpy bumps flopping around.

So needless to say, I am a big believer in stereo subs. But why? If sub-bass is longer than the room I‚Äôm sitting in, why should it make such a pronounced difference?"
audiophile,"What is a good way to tell if high end equipment or recordings are worth the effort anymore? 60 years old, did the rock clubs and concerts, worked in loud computer rooms, etc etc etc.. I have tinnitus.

Long time ago NPR or related org published on their website a quiz on ""can you tell the difference"" between mp3, FLAC, wav, etc. I failed mostly, but honestly not sure if it was the stream and the computer, or me.

How is a good way to tell that I might as well buy cheaper mp3s or I really can tell the difference?"
audiophile,"Hi everyone! 

I'm a novice audiophile and I've been looking for some equipment for my main system. While shopping around, I come to find that second handed market stuff is very tempting, with a lot of stuff advertising ""original price : $1000, now price $300""

As long as the equipment is not broken in obvious way, which audio equipment can you recommend buying second instead new unit? 

For example, I think speaker is mostly futureproof. A good speaker from the 90's might be more power hungry than the newer one, but great sounding speaker should still sound great even without the high-res sticker. 

On the other hand though, I think buying older audio streamer might possess some issue such as no software updates, no support for newer audio format etc. 

But what about other component such as DAC, amplifier, AVR etc?"
audiophile,"Ok so I have some 4 ohm speakers in my trailer and if I was to splice the L and R chanels it would take it down to 2 ohm (I'm pretty sure).

Would that make the volume I hear at the same volume number on the radio head unit louder. Like #20 is hard to hear currently, would that make #20 easier to hear because it's louder or would it be quieter?

Speakers Kicker ESC65, Radio Jensen JWM22."

audiophile,"Hi! In the last year I have bought a a turntable and begun collecting vinyl records, and something that has been interesting me is the difference between digital and analog records. I understand that most vinyl records being pressed and sold today (which sell for around $30 most of the time) are digitally mastered. But what does that actually mean? The analog version of the same record costs 4 to 5 times as much, but will it really sound any different? I'm curious what all of the fuss is about.

Bonus question: My turntable (made by 1 by one) is advertised to convert analog sound into a digital form, and also has bluetooth connectivity. As a result, playing one of my records sounds identical to simply connecting my phone to my amp and playing the same record on Spotify. Is it really the same thing, or can my ears just not tell the difference?"
audiophile,"As the title says, I'm looking a budget speakers choice for games (A Nintendo Switch on a 27"" desktop monitor) but good enough to play hi-fi music, the setup will be very basic since I'm not using any dac/amp device for extra power. They won't be for gaming exclusively but that's the main use they'll have. 

Does anyone know about anything? Budget is around $150-200.

Thanks in advance!!!"
audiophile,"Just picked up a pair of Revel M16s. They‚Äôre being driven off a SMSL A300 for now via Bluetooth. I am looking at some vintage receivers to pair with the speakers. Current local options are Pioneer SX-780, SX-626, and Yamaha CR-820. I believe the 820 have the highest output wattage and the 626 have the lowest.

Sorry if that was confusing I'm kinda new to speakers"
audiophile,"I'm having some trouble figuring out how I should be powering these speakers because of their odd ohm ratings. 

The BR08s have a minimum ohm rating of 3 with a nominal rating of 8 ohms. 
The BRC1 has a minimum ohm rating of 5.3 with a nominal rating of 8 ohms.

I currently have them connected to an Onkyo TX-SR393 receiver.  I think the receiver is failing as I notice the bass will disappear for a few seconds periodically and then come back a few seconds later.   This is from the subwoofer and not just the Triangles.  Then in some songs it sounds like there is scratching in the speakers but I have hope that this is because either the receiver is failing, the signal im feeding the speakers isn't always hifi, or the receiver isn't suitable for the speakers.  

The Onkyo receiver has these ratings:
80 W/Ch (8 Ohms, 20 Hz‚Äì20 kHz, 0.08% THD, 2 Channels Driven, FTC) 155 W/Ch (6 Ohms, 1 kHz, 10% THD, 1 Channel Driven)

So yea, that 10% THD could also be part of the problem.  

I'd like to find a more appropriate way to power these speakers.  I use this setup for tv/movies and music as they're my mains in my living room.  

How would you power these?  Is a receiver still my best bet?  If so, what ratings on the receiver should I be comfortable with considering the odd ohm ratings of the Triangles?  Any recommendations below $1k?"
audiophile,"So, I'm not an audiophile, but my dad is very hardcore about music and audio quality. He literally grew up in a recording studio.

I have a feeling I know the answer to this, but in case I'm wrong, do y'all think the audio quality on Spotify is enough for someone like that?"

audiophile,"I currently use Edifier R1850DB speakers paired with a Klipsch 12"" sub running through an Optical port for my PC.  I am considering ditching the sub for a few reasons, and selling both sub and speakers in favor of really good bookshelf speakers that pump out better bass.  I don't use any sort of amp or reciever, just the optical, so I need something powered that won't rattle or make noise when under heavy bass load.  The R1850DB set is great, but if I crank the bass the speaker rattles a bit.  It isn't loose or damaged, just not built for it.  Looking for recommendations.  I have a pretty good budget, probably about 500$ or less, but open to suggestions."

audiophile,"Hi,why very few people know and understand what is bi amping? Since speakers have different frequency response on different distance,different rooms and even on different volume,having bi amping and setup microphone would make a perfect sound in listening postition,with just right eq and frequency delay with most of the speakers,so why it's not widely spread?"
audiophile,"Ill try my best to keep this concise, but I have recently just swapped out the last 2 factory speakers (not incl. tweeters) in my 2020 Honda Civic Sport.

After installing my new JBL Premium Speakers (GTO629, 3ohm, co-axial, 60RMS) and moving my old Kickers (DSC650, 4ohm, coaxial, 60RMS) to the rear deck, and as I started to turn up the volume, id say 3/4 of the way, I would get occasional loss of audio in all 4 of my speakers (which I understand is called clipping) and the loss of audio would persist until I turned the volume down and left it there for a while.

Obviously the solution is to buy an external amp to power the speakers, as my understanding is the Civic‚Äôs stock unit can only handle 160w ‚Äî however, I already have an amp installed for my dual 12‚Äù subwoofers (I‚Äôll provide a link to the amp in the replies), however, even though its 1100W, im pretty certain it cannot handle the speakers AND subwoofers.

So in that case, Ive found temporary success in lowering the bass levels on my head unit, as well as slightly fading the signal to my rear deck where the Kickers are. The clipping still happens occasionally depending on the song, but it is much less present.

If there are any solutions to the clipping that do not require the installation of a new amp, and allow me to enjoy full volume without limiting bass, I would love to know!"

audiophile,"Hi! I have the Samsung HWQ950A too and don't want to give away any potential because I'm doing wrong things in terms of settings. 

I connected the soundbar with a fiber optic HDMI cable. One end goes into my TV connection (ARC) and the other end into my soundbar (ARC) Unfortunately, my TV does not support eARC, so no Dolby Atmos at the moment.

I use a Philips TV (2018) and I've gone through all the settings and I can set the following on my TV:

\- Stereo (uncompressed)

\- Multichannel

\- Multichannel (Bypass)

\- Dolby Digital Plus 

What do I choose here? I use the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for movies. When I select Dolby Digital Plus, I often have problems, namely as soon as I switch the TV off and on again, there is no sound. I then go back into the settings, click on Dolby Digital Plus again and then it works. So far I don't know what the problem is. If I select Stereo (uncompressed) I also get the 5.1 sound and I don¬¥t have this no sound problem, but is that simulated 5.1 and not real?

With the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K itself I can set the following:

\- Best available

\- PCM

\- Dolby Digital Plus

\- Dolby Digital

Here I have currently selected ""Best available"", so that the best possible is automatically used. Do I maybe have to make some settings on the soundbar? If someone could help me that would be great. Thank you for reading."
audiophile,"I have a pair of B&amp;W 706 S2s on my main 2.1 stereo set up. They're pretty good, resolving speakers. But I'm not in love with them.  (I run the B&amp;Ws through a Rega Brio, which really tightened up the muddy bass) Have chance to buy Lintons, which everyone raves about (no one raves about B&amp;Ws). I have Wharfedale Denton 80s, so I know and like the brand. Can't decide if I should pull the trigger on the Lintons. Help!"
audiophile,"Absolutly noobie to having nicer audio equipment. I got the kanto yu2s and cannot get them to work with the USB connector due to it saying ""power surge on usb"" (unless i plug the speakers into the wall instead of powerbar) so sadly I use the 3.5mm jack. Then I picked up the sub8 since I found it was lacking on bass being such small speakers but to my surprise my previous $40 logitech set up had more of a punch to it. The sub8 is plugged into the yu2 directly with the included RCA cable. There's some bass even with the volume up all the way on the sub it's a very quiet and low rumble at best. The logitech although it sounds horrible in comparison actually had a punch or thump to it.

Sorry for the longer post but I guess my questions are

1.How should I plug my speakers in and is it just a power bar quality issue?

2. Why is the sub8 so quiet? I can't even tell if it's working unless I'm moving my head basically next to the sub"
audiophile,"(summation of question is at the end, kept short-ish)

when i search for things, i can always find them, until now. first time this has ever happened, kinda flipping my shit about it, to be honest. simply put, i have this...

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X70X872/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o08\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X70X872/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

notice it has a 2.5mm TS/mono plug. i need to plug this into a gopro8 mediamod, so that means a 3.5mm TRS (not ts and not trrs) plug is needed.

&amp;#x200B;

however, i've worked my way through a ton of adapters and my snobby self has even bought things like this:

[https://audio46.com/collections/dd-ddhifi/products/dd-ddhifi-dj35a-2-5mm-balanced-female-adapter-to-3-5mm-male-headphone-jack-adapter](https://audio46.com/collections/dd-ddhifi/products/dd-ddhifi-dj35a-2-5mm-balanced-female-adapter-to-3-5mm-male-headphone-jack-adapter)

&amp;#x200B;

...aaaaaand it doesnt work. QUESTION:

is there any technical reason why an adapter which converts to a 3.5mm \*TRS\* must also have a trs input?

2.5mm female TS ---&gt; 3.5mm male TRS does not seem to exist. at all. anywhere. it just occurred to me earlier today there might be some electrical/engineering related reason why not..?

i've even fired off messages to companies that do high end stuff such as cables in a desperate attempt to have something custom made, haha, so thanks for any help in advance."
audiophile,"It‚Äôs difficult to find a comparison of the major active stereo speakers on the market so I wanted to start a discussion and see if anyone has any experience they can share.

I‚Äôve been looking into this for myself recently and feel a bit stuck. There isn‚Äôt really a great permanent place to put these speakers in my house for anything beyond casual listening, so they need to be easy enough to move around to various rooms when I want to have more focused listening. Also, they have to look good and not clunky according to my wife, hence the active speakers. I‚Äôve been looking into four different solutions, but would be open to hearing about others as well. These are Devialet phantoms, KEF LS60 Wireless, Dynaudio Focus 30/50, and Buchardt A700.

Devialet Phantom 108db

I know there are mixed feelings about these, and that they are generally thought of as not the best speakers you can get for this price, but I can look past that as they do solve for a lot of my needs in theory. I like how small the form factor is and how easy they are to move around. I‚Äôd probably even be comfortable moving these outside for a party, which is a plus. Beyond that, they look very nice and would probably be the only speakers on this list that would be a net positive in home aesthetics. One of my main concerns with other speakers is that they would not get low enough, and I care about the idea of feeling that sub 20hz extension.

I was recently in New York on a trip and went to listen to these. This is my first time listening to ‚Äúexpensive speakers‚Äù, at least beyond the level of Sonos, but they didn‚Äôt thrill me for the most part. The guy working there was very friendly, but the music he demoed didn‚Äôt leave me feeling like I was close to experiencing the music live, what you might call ‚Äúhigh fidelity‚Äù. To be fair, these are demoed in a small glass box with no obvious acoustic treatment and with the door open. I don‚Äôt know if it was the speakers themselves or the room, but both clarity and bass were a little underwhelming for the price. However, I did ask him to play the finale of Camille Saint Saens‚Äô organ concerto and the low pedal tones of the pipe organ coming from these speakers almost gave me the chills. I heard things I have never heard from that recording.

KEF LS60 Wireless

I haven‚Äôt had the chance to listen to these as the nearest dealer is about an hour away and it‚Äôs hard to find that sort of time lately. From everything I have seen online, these seem like fantastic speakers and I think they would probably blow me away in most areas, however I have a couple of concerns. Most importantly, they do not go very low. These do not seem to be the speakers to get if you value the low end bass extension in the tower speakers themselves. They do have a subwoofer input, but then we get back to the clunky factor. The recommended KEF subwoofer is small enough, but if I have to buy a separate subwoofer I‚Äôd probably be tempted to get something nicer and then it would be even more clunky. Furthermore, I‚Äôve seen a lot of bad reviews about the KEF app having issues that are concerning. Everyone praises the Sonos ecosystem, but the issues I have with it drive me nuts so I can only imagine what a worse app experience would feel like.

Dynaudio Focus 30/50

The Dynaudio Focus series seems like it could potentially be a winner here, but if you value the low end then it seems the 50 would probably be the way to go and it‚Äôs quite a bit more expensive than the other options. Beyond the low end, I can‚Äôt tell from my research if it‚Äôs significantly better than the other options, although it does seem to have the best room correction which would be helpful if you are changing their location from time to time. Also, I can‚Äôt tell if there is a dealer near me in Southern California because the functionality to find a dealer on their site doesn‚Äôt seem to work on any of my devices.

Buchardt A700

Purely based on the speakers themselves for the price, it seems like these should be the winner. The technical stats are extremely impressive and the few instances I have seen where people try them they seem to love them. However, it‚Äôs also a small new company and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm comfortable spending that much on active speakers that depend on the ongoing success of Buchardt. They do have a try at home feature, which is very nice, but I always feel bad about the idea of returning an expensive product I have tried and I think it biases me in the evaluation, which is hard to control even if I am conscious of it.

So that‚Äôs where I am at. Has anyone else been in this situation recently? Any experience with these or other similar systems to share?"
audiophile,"Focal Elegia used to cost more than $800 but now they cost less than half that.  So does that mean:

1) they never actually had an $800 sound and the current price is really correct for the sound?  

2) the current price is an amazing value, because they still have an $800 sound?  

3) they were overpriced for the sound, but the current price is still a great value, because the sound is still worth more than what they cost (i.e. somewhere in between)?

4) Not even worth the current asking price?

5) something else worth discussion?"
audiophile,"I am looking for a smallish amp for a desk use with some Ttiangle Comete 40th anniversary. I bought a cheap Smsl ao200 and it actually sounds decent but it‚Äôs messing up some games I run when in use. I‚Äôve had a NAD d3045 before and it sounds good but the vertical form factor and finish bugs me. There is the Marantz HD amp 1 used sometimes and I wonder if it is still competitive a few years later. Lastly I guess other options are PS sprout 100 or get an external DAC for the Smsl amp or something else? It‚Äôs a small room, I have a quad Vena II I brought down and honestly the Smsl sounds nearly as good."
audiophile,"Since I use a phone as my portable player I've trying Musepack lately I quite peeved how overlooked It is. At 160kbps(--quality 4.9) It rivals AAC &amp; Vorbis while making MP3 look like hot garbage, Seen tests where even performs better than AAC/Vorbis at 320kbps. Also seems to have near-lossless(Wavpack lossy) properties meaning you could turn It into a lossless codec without much effort at all. Even at 160kbps if It can't compress something without quality loss it will just encode sections to whole thing at 384 ~ 1200kbps. 

FYI this why DAB radio system uses MP2 audio(what MPC was based on) at 256kbps instead of using AAC or MP3 at 256kbps. Turns out MDCT audio compression sucks when It comes to complex audio hell someone on Hydrogenaudio posted a killer sample for Opus/AAC at 256kbps where It mangles the 16KHz ~ 22KHz area causing issues. Meanwhile musepack at 256kbps(--quality 7.4) It stops using a lowpass filter."
audiophile,"I have this (https://imgur.com/a/9yAl3Gh) room which is a kitchen/living, and it's laid out pretty much as the plan shows. The room measures 390cm x 780cm. The red circles are where I planned to put in-ceiling speakers in and already have the cables in place, leading to the TV Unit. I'm trying to figure out what speakers, sub and amp (was thinking Yanaha RX V6A0) for a set up that's good for both movie watching and also background music. But I have no idea what specs to look out for. Any pointers please?"

audiophile,"Newly joined here. Hope someone can help me. 
I recently played a DSD version and Apple ALAC version of an album and found the Apple version was better than the DSD one. Is this expected or do I need to tweak the settings? I realise it is apples to oranges comparison since I streamed the Apple audio from my phone via Bluetooth and DSD via USB cable.

DAC - CXA61
Windows OS-10
Software used to play DSD - JRiver 30.  I confirmed on JRiver to ensure that the DAC is receiving pure DSD input."
audiophile,"If the sound was the same, would you prefer your hifi system to be visible or completely hidden? I enjoy the sound of a good hifi system, including my own modest setup, but have yet to see a system that I think actually improves the aesthetics of an ordinary living room. Even neutral looks are rare: Most hifi systems look like piles of expensive clutter, acceptable in a living room only because they serve a purpose (sound). I can admire the engineering of components and I like tinkering with the setup, but when it comes to the aesthetics of my surroundings, I would prefer the hifi system to be invisible and occupy zero space. Unfortunately, a decent-sounding system based on in-wall speakers is way outside budget, as is a dedicated room."
audiophile,I'm thinking of buying a set of cheap bookshelf speakers for an average-sized room. I've looked at the NEUMI BS5 and wonder if they're better than the Moukey M20-3 or the Klipsch R-14M Monitor speakers. Can't find any straightforward comparisons. These are all under $300 on amazon and elsewhere. Any thoughts on which one is better? I'm looking for a set of bookshelf speakers for a Fosi Audio BT20A Bluetooth 5.0 Amplifier. Thanks in advance.
audiophile,"So, my son, college freshman, is into vinyl. He‚Äôs always had a cheap, rack stereo system, but it wouldn‚Äôt work very well in his dorm. Anyway, I came across a deal on a pro-ject vote bt with a set of audioengine a5+ wireless speakers for really surprisingly little cash and scooped it up Christmas.

I know the turntable is more of an ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù deck, but it‚Äôs still pro-ject so I expect it will be decent. Do you guys think this setup would make an okay ‚Äúfirst real vinyl kit‚Äù for a college kid?"
audiophile,"I'm having trouble picking up out some wired earphones on Amazon. I want ones that are cheap, good sounding, and not ugly. The previous earphones I had were: 

Samsung AKG wired aux earphones (probably came with the galaxy s4 or s5 phones, i don't know)
Sony WI-XB400 wireless Bluetooth earphones

I only like wired because they sound better and have no latency."
audiophile,"From my research, Owsley ""Bear"" Stanley was a great, and somewhat unknown, thinker of his time - in the 60's and 70's. Now, not having lived in that time period, or known him personally, nor have the audio listening experience or wisdom to debate his ideas I'm presenting - I am simply curious of the thoughts of those who do have studio ears and experience critically listening on the subject of analog vs digital. From the man himself on his now very outdated website: http://thebear.org/essays2.html#anchor506008
With the idea that vinyl is inherently flawed, especially after it's first time being played, I heard that he (Owsley) would buy 2 copies of each record, keep one unopened, and the other play only ONCE and record it to his Ampex 352 tape recorder - with any future listening via the tape, not the record. While also having a backup in case the tape was lost or damaged! That was the the most audiophile thing I've ever heard! Makes sense to me..
This all being said, I still fully enjoy listening to the MUSIC whether it be a record, CD, or file. Cheers"
audiophile,"More than electric humming - sounds like an electric zap (like the i imagine Frankenstein coming to life- if I‚Äôm not crazy may also have an  signal pickup) in an old set of audio engine a5 powered speakers when the aux input is plugged in.

**Background:**

My first foray into non-headphone Hifi.

First, a story. I fell in love with hifi headphones and Schiit components after realizing I couldn't tell the difference between the Tidal I was paying for and lower quality compressed audio on my hifi-man headphones. I used this test, and I couldn't pass it - [https://abx.digitalfeed.net/](https://abx.digitalfeed.net/)

Then, I tried the same test with a Schiit Jotunheim and I passed the test and I was blown away by the additional detail I heard in everything I was playing. 

So, after selling my last company, I decided to take some of the proceeds and give myself the gift of sound. Once I found the JBLs on sale, the rest fell into place. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Configuration:**

One of the coolest things about this system is that I played with the crossover and the tweeter settings on the SVS app / front of the JBL 4349s and I was able to make the subs only come in at the bottom of the JBL's bottom end of the range. You can't place the subs in the room, but you can feel the oomph when it kicks in, especially in hip-hop and electronic style tracks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Listening Notes:**

The system still sounds extremely detailed and dynamic, even on much more delicate tracks/genres.

Shout out to Steve Guttenberg AKA the Audiophiliac, his reviews of my components and speakers were spot on. The thing they all excel at is both warmth and dynamics. Louds are loud, quiets are quiet, precision and warmth permeate throughout everything in a really exciting way. 

&amp;#x200B;

The following songs have blown me away on this system, if you have anything similar I cannot recommend the following enough for testing the unique dynamics of the JBLs:

[https://tidal.com/browse/track/251370799](https://tidal.com/browse/track/251370799) \- Precise vocals, presence like you are in the first row

[https://tidal.com/browse/track/238853991](https://tidal.com/browse/track/238853991) \- Insane bass complexity, better than any club

[https://tidal.com/browse/track/247809749](https://tidal.com/browse/track/247809749) \- Full range, beautiful and complex jazz (the jazz is dead label/series is incredible, recommend all their stuff)

&amp;#x200B;

**My Gear:**

**Not Schiit:** 

* JBL 4349 x2
* VPI Cliffwood
* Cambridge Audio CXN V2 - Dac + Network Streamer
* SVS 3000 Micro Subwoofer x2

**Schiit Stack:**

* Aegir (Monoblock) x2
* Freya+
* Mani

**Isolation Table:**

* Adona Corporation Eris 6dw

I'd like to connect my iFi Zen Stream to the Denafrips for it's DAC capability. then I would route the output from the Denafrips to the Denon AVR, where the speakers are attached for the amplification. Since the Denon AVR also has a DAC, how do I know for sure that the Denon will merely pass on the Denafrips DAC signal and not it's own, inferior DAC signal, to the speakers?"

My dad is looking for a new AVR. He showed me some new Marantz that is aboht 4K that he wants and I told him it was pretty overkill. Reason I‚Äôm reaching out to this group is because of his main interests. 
1. He‚Äôs a pretty big audio guy with super nice phono player, great speakers etc. think he wants something that just offers great stereo sound for his old records and whatnot. 
2. Other thing is that he has a 5.1 setup in basement as the main that he likes, with 4K tv, and then also outside stereo zone and upstairs stereo zone (powered or not, he has the amps also so pre out zones is cool)

Any Rec‚Äôs on a setup that would fit his 5.1, 3 zone needs whilst not compromising on good audio quality? I just don‚Äôt think he needs to put his momey towards some 11.4 channel 8k Dolby Marantz whatever receiver. Thanks ahead"
audiophile,"Dear Audiophiles,
I went the cinder block route for speaker stands for Kef LS50 bookshelf speakers. Needed 5 blocks per stand for the proper height. Laying the blocks sideways on top of each other, but those flat sides aren‚Äôt entirely flat - each block wobbles a bit on each other. I‚Äôm thinking 5 sorbothane pads between each block (4 corners and 1 center). I would account for the different sorbothane durometer needs given the bottom block has a lot more weight on it than the top block etc. Is this a good idea? 

Also, thinking about staining / sealing the blocks - any recommendations here are welcome as well. 

Very Sincerely Yours,

audiophile,"It seems to me that the digital to analogue conversion may be aggravating my Tinnitus but I've never heard anyone directly link the two.  What do you think?  Can lousy conversion aggravate Tinnitus?  I use equalization and it helps a lot and have found headphones just aggravate it no matter the volume or equalization settings.  I listen with high quality speakers but they are only about 18"" from my ears.  If I move them farther away this may help which I will experiment with in the future.  Then I wondered if it could be high frequency noise from the power amp.  My Tinnitus has stabilized over the last few years.  Its there all the time but I don't really react to it.  It sure would be nice to hear ""blackness"" once in a while.  I find I seem to have pressure in my ear canal but I've had my ears checked and there's no significant wax blockage.  I hold my nose and breathe out creating a little pressure and it ""pops"" a bit and it feels like its so open.  Then it closes right back.  My weird ears.....  (In the past I went to a lot of nightclubs and listened to a lot of music at relatively high volumes at home, both through speakers and high quality headphones like top of the line Grados and Stax electrostatics running with high end Conrad Johnson and Audio Research tube electronics.  It took about 2 decades to start.  When I see young people blasting with earbuds it just seems so sad.  They will pay dearly later."
audiophile,"For all of the hand-wringing in the audiophile community over small changes made by swapping solid state equipment, minor eq tweaks, small adjustments to placement, etc., it's surprising that I almost never hear anyone talk about Fletcher Munson curves. Here's a very basic explanation of what they are: [https://producelikeapro.com/blog/fletcher-munson-curve/](https://producelikeapro.com/blog/fletcher-munson-curve/)

The TLDR explanation is that you perceive different frequencies at different levels of loudness depending on the overall listening level in the room. When listening at low levels, midrange tends to dominate your hearing, and you perceive high frequencies (and especially low frequencies) as being significantly attenuated. At loud listening levels the opposite happens - bass becomes overwhelming and treble is boosted. It's not a subtle effect either, listening at extremely low or high volume (&lt;60dB SPL, &gt;80dB SPL) can have essentially the same effect as cranking the low and high frequencies on an EQ all the way down, and is a far more extreme change than would be perceived by almost any equipment upgrade.

If you want to listen with close to accurate frequency perception, you should be listening somewhere in the 80dB SPL range. Of course everything is subjective and you should listen at safe volumes that you enjoy, but it's worth knowing that the apparently average 60dB listening levels around here are essentially applying a really aggressive reverse smiley face eq to everything coming out of your system."
audiophile,"I am using a Xiaomi 11X,  on paper it supports AptX HD and the internal DAC on the Snapdragon supports about 
32 bit/384 khz PCM audio.  Sounds pretty good too with my Moondrop ARIAs and CCA CRA+s (with the KZ AZ09 Pro bluetooth adapter) 

My question is this, I often hear audiophiles talking about the need for an external DAC/Amp to drive IEMs and Headphones, but as far as I understand as long as the IEM/Headphone has been tuned according to your preferences and is at a fairly low impedance, the external DAC/Amp won't really add any value

Also, a follow up to that is, that I wanted to continue in the Android ecosystem due to AptX and LDAC support for bluetooth audio, and my source is Apple Music. 
I'm thinking about upgrading to the Pixel 7 but I'm unable to find any information about it's internal DAC/Amp as well as the bluetooth codecs it supports

Any help on the above queries would be greatly appreciated!!!"

audiophile,"Trying to purchase an audio interface for a Rhode Podmic, I have tried the scarlett solo and it's far too weak too run a Podmic to my desired volume. I'm looking for a interface capable of running 75db+ that is around 100-150$. I really just want the Podmic to sound loud enough as if I'm using a condenser mic (which typically sounds more than loud enough). I like the way the dynamic mics sound and how they don't pick up as much background noise. But most interfaces require some sort of cloud lifer which I'm trying to avoid. Makes the most sense to purchase an interface that's powerful to run a dynamic mic without requiring additional gear like a cloud lifter or a fethead.

Is there any good recommendations? Personal experience? I'm still quite new so I'm all ears here, I do know I want a dynamic mic with plenty of juice without breaking the bank."
audiophile,"The idea of getting a record player has peaked my interest. I know absolutely nothing about it, but I am a home theater enthusiast. I have 2 Polk Tower Speakers and a 9.2 Channel AV Receiver that also has pre amp capabilities.

My budget for a record player is about $200. From my understanding, some record players do not come with amps or built in speakers. Since I already have both of those, can I buy that type of player and hood it up to my home theater av receiver?

My theory is that the players without those features should be less money, allowing me to buy a higher end one for my budget range. 

What do you guys think? What should I be looking at? I am an audiophile, but I honestly never tried listening to music on my system weirdly enough."

audiophile,"At this moment I'm a very proud owner of two Q acoustics 3030i's paired with the B12 sub. To power them I use my Denon AVR X1600h.

Currently, I have a really old generation Samsung (not so smart anymore) TV. Because of the smart functions that are not working anymore, I use a Google TV chromecast - with this I stream music from Spotify and Tidal. From this TV I have a Digital optical cable running to my AVR. Sometimes I stream directly via HEOS (Denon's streaming app that supports both these apps). 

Are there options for me to improve my sound quality here? I think my TV bottlenecks my soundquality here - but I'm not sure. Also, I think the HEOS app is not perfect for streaming hifi quality music (correct me if I'm wrong).

I'm looking for a new TV, that supports eARC - with that I want to stream music to this new TV. Is this a better solution, or does this not change anything? Is it better to use an external streaming device in order to achieve real hifi quality?

audiophile,Has anyone set this device up to work off of a networked Windows machine running Serviio or another DNLA option?
audiophile,"Generally speaking, when and what gear do you couple or decouple from one another?

Historically, I've just had speakers and the powered sub on a carpeted floor.   All the gear is in a single cabinet with the TT on top.  However, we've pulled the carpet from that room, so now the cabinet wobbles a bit and that means no records till it's fixed.

I'm going to shim the underside of the cabinet to level and stabilize it, but should I also isolate the TT from the cabinet?  If so, spikes, springs, squash balls, anti-gravity magnetic fields??!?  

While carpeted, the TT didn't skip unless someone was doing jumping jacks near it or stomping around too much (I've got a kid and a big dog, it has happened).

For initial treatments, I'm leaning towards some bass traps behind the speakers and something to mitigate sidewall reflections.  The opposite wall (facing the cones) has a large window, and so...a large curtain, but there's nothing in those corners yet.

Far from completed, but even with my wife's lead ears, she finally heard the speakers 'disappear'!

Historically she hasn't been able to tell the difference between a cell phone speaker and a full range tower, other than ""one is louder than the other"" so...it's progress."

( image is a picture of my desk and speaker looking from the side rather than the front. )

 As you can see in my image, I'm using a bass trap on the front with one installed behind each speaker. 

 What I'm curious about is that the bass wrap doesn't cover the port on the back.   
Do i have to get something like a pedestal on the floor and raise the height of the basstrap? (At least 20cm, enough to cover the back of the speaker completely?)   
 Or is the fact that there is a bass trap on the back of the speaker already effective? I'm curious. 

(btw,  In my corner, I have installed a base trap with two tiers filled up to the ceiling. However, only one bass strap on the front (behind each speaker) will be maintained. It's unstable if you stack two. )"

But with that set up, i can notice audio lag when i play rhythm games. Im guessing the TV converting the digital HDMI signal to the Optical causes a bit of lag?  I would say a normal gamer would never notice this lag, only when i play rhythm games do i notice it, the lag is very small. But it is enough to make a rhythm game annoying to play.  If i turn on my TV speakers and my Receiver speakers at the same time you can hear it too ...

If you have a similar setup i would ask you to test by allowing sound to come out of the TV speakers the same time as your receiver and see if notice any effect in the sound. Im willing to bet there is lag.

audiophile,"Hi all, 

I've recently purchased a nice set of Dali Opticon 6 soeakers (used). System is been connected for a few weeks now and sounding very good. 

The previous owner mentioned that there was no need for tilting the speakers as the wide dispersion tweeters would be designed to cover the broadest range for most listening positions. 

Now this evening I decided to get up close with the speakers to see if I could hear anything from the wide dispersion units. These are placed at the top of the speakers, followed by a regular tweeter and the drivers below. 

I noticed the sound was only coming from the ""normal"" tweeters and the drivers, but not from the wide dispersion tweeters on both sides. 

Am I supposed to not hear them? Do I need to activate them in some way or are they broken. And if so, how do I check if they indeed are faulty? 

They can be bi-wired but currently aren't. They're hooked up to an Atoll IN200 Signature integrated amplifier and running on Van den Hul Magnum cables. I furthermore use a DACmagic 100 via optical cable to listen to my music.

All ok working order with the turntable still in the box unopened. Seems to be amp, cassettes, cD and radio units with the original kenwood speakers. 

Unfortunately she cut all the wires instead of unplugging them so I have to rewire the cables in the back but I have looked into it and know what needs fixing. I am chuffed to bits!"

audiophile,"So i recently aquired a 5.0 surround set:  
2x Jamo s809  
2x Jamo S803  
1x Jamo S83  


The placement of the speakers are NOT ideal however there is no other way to place them as the livingroom is shaped like someone tried to make the worst possible layout. We are very tight on budget but are willing to invest overtime to improve where we can!

  
The 2 S809's are placed in 90 degree corners and have front facing bass ports, would it help to angle the speakers towards the sweetspot? Would it be even better if i did that and put acoustic panels on the sidewalls? Should i place basstraps in the  corner behind the speakers eventhough the bass port is front facing? Do you have any other advice on how to improve the soundquality when in corners?  


The S803's are placed directly next to the couch. Where the S809's are about 2.5M from the sweetspot, the S803's are about 1.2M away from the sweet spot. Would this result in a bad surround experience? If so, can i fix that by turning down the volume of the surround speakers?  Do you have any other tips on how to improve surround sound quality?"
audiophile,I converted a bunch of FLAC files to MP4 by accident. I meant to convert to lossless M4A and was careless. If I convert those MP4s to ALAC will the audio still be lossless?

audiophile," A little background on me in general. I am a college student with a good ear for music texture and quality and I grew up in a very musically rich household (thank you mom and dad). Now I got into watching crin after I realized my previous earbuds we're getting really old and bland (I was using gas station buds). I saw his video about his $36 KZ collab and bought those and made another realization that I am a total bass head because when I got them I was like ""uhhh wheres the bass??"" Ultimately disappointed in the end and thought ""I guess I can't hear what others are hearing"" and went on with my life. Now a few months go by and I'm now back in town. I text my friend to see if he wants to hangout since I haven't seen him in 3 months. One key detail was he recently bought the 7hz Timeless and he told me over discord while I was away and being the person that I am, when I got to his house I asked if I could try them on. Let me tell you I have never been moved to tears the way the Timeless did to me. EVERY SINGLE SONG I played had my head bopping, my body moving and my chair shaking. Words cannot DESCRIBE the experience i had with these and putting my other earbuds back in (Moon drop aria/ Samsung Galaxy buds pro 2) made these sound like complete dog water. And yes yes I know the Timeless is on a whole other planet compared to this stuff, It's still a lot for my ears to take in. I have made up my mind and ANY MONEY I get from work or anything will be going to purchase a pair of Timeless.   Ok rant over thank you for reading üìñ (thank u crin for the greats vids)"

With Tonewinner it sounded slightly bright and fatiguing after about 20 mins.

audiophile,"I have an Pioneer SX-1250 which I have had sorted. I need to take it back to fix an aux port issue (damn them for not checking it, damn me for not checking after getting it sorted). I plan to have the shop sort that as well. Aside from that, it works great. 

It's awesome. It absolutely lives up to it's billing. The thing is that I cannot afford to build a system based on that without going years to stumble upon stupid deals on great components to go with it. I'd like to have a good system and I don't care to spend years acquiring it. 

I'm thinking about offering it up for trade. The question is, what is the worth of this thing vs. what is the worth of a really good system which will satisfy me for years to come?  

My question to you all is, can I expect to offer the receiver up as a trade for a good quality complete system? Currently, my idea of a good system is a good tube-based system, a pair of good speakers, and a turntable. Could I reasonably expect to trade this thing for a good tube integrated amp, a pair of really good speakers (Klipsch Fortes/Chorus/Quartets, high end Bozak, old/new Wharfedale Lintons/W90s, etc) and a decent turntable? 

I would like to turn the SX-1250 into a badass old school stereo system - maybe not as good as what is possible with the Pioneer, but very good nonetheless. Am I way out of whack with my thinking?"

audiophile,"Hello /r/audiophile,

I feel incredibly stupid asking this question but I am trying to be a good neighbor while still enjoying some bass with my music. I've had neighbors that would play music loud enough that I can see vibrations in my water glass. I want to avoid being *that* nightbor. 

If I put my foot next to the subwoofer and I cannot feel any vibration, is it a safe bet that I'm not annoying my downstairs neighbor? Also what WOULD be a good gauge to tell when my music has started resonating into their apartment? 

This is a side view of how our apartments are stacked and where my subwoofer is located:

audiophile,"In the early 1950s my uncle Lloyd was inspired by Les Paul and Mary Ford, who were pioneers of recording multiple tracks. On their releases, Mary sang duets with herself while Les accompanied with multiple guitar tracks. 

[https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=vaya+con+dios](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=vaya+con+dios)

Uncle Lloyd's problem was that he didn't have access to a recording studio, so he laid down multiple guitar tracks the hard way - recording the first track, then accompanying himself as he played the first track back and recorded the whole thing all over again. Needless to say, each iteration lost resolution. 

All he could afford was something like the Sears and Roebuck portable Silvertone  reel-to-reel shown. Despite the fact he was an accomplished guitarist,  by the time he got through four tracks everything was muddy and bass-heavy. 

I have been digitizing his tapes in .wav format, largely to preserve them for family history. 

Here is my question. On one hand, I am tempted to try to ""cure"" his lousy tracks by playing around with the equalizer. On the other hand, common sense tells me I cannot manufacture audio fidelity that does not exist on the source recordings. This looks like a great way to waste many hours, all to no avail.

audiophile,"Hello,

After a first review of the special [40th anniversary editions](https://magicvinyldigital.net/2022/11/19/michael-jackson-thriller-40th-anniversary-review-vinyl-cd-qobuz-tidal-sony-360-reality-audio-360ra/), it took me some time to realize the large review of the Thriller album with 21 versions including Vinyl, CD, cassette, SACD including the new versions produced by MOFI from the analog master tape recorded in DSD256.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oyssjx4uuy2a1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d54de2dc98aa93c79213fef8cce89ca166d0e729

Thriller is the best selling album in the world, with more than 600 versions available, here is an overview of some of the characteristic versions, such as the US vinyl, Japanese, MasterSound, MOFI, the first CD as well as the 2001 and Thriller 25/40 editions, and two SACD versions. All these versions are completed by the streaming and Sony 360 Reality Audio versions.

Difficult to summarize the test in a few lines, but here are some characteristics encountered on the versions tested:

* For the CD version, the CD of 1983 transcribes a very nice dynamic (DR13) unlike the special edition of 2001 and for the anniversary editions of 25 years and 40 years.
* In the continuity, the streaming versions are all compressed in dynamics that it is for the version Thriller or the anniversary versions Thriller 25 and Thriller 40. However, there is an exception, the Qobuz version of the original album in Hi-Res 24 bits 176.4 kHz is the PCM version of the SACD edition and benefits from the best streaming rendering.
* The SACD versions bring the best of the digital versions with the MOFI SACD followed by the 1999 SACD.
* To finish with the digital versions, the version in 360 (RA) Reality Audio brings a great rendering in 7.1.4 restitution, but in binaural, this version does not follow the fineness and the presence of the stereo vinyl and SACD versions.

Concerning the vinyl, the great curiosity is the MOFI version, this version is very clean with a quality pressing and a fineness of the details in the top of the spectrum, this fineness is partly due to the work of mastering made on this version. The curve below compares the spectrum of the MOFI SACD and the MOFI vinyl, we can see that the detail in the upper part of the spectrum is due to an accentuation of the vinyl above 12 kHz, accentuation going up to +7 dB.

Among the other vinyls, we note the very good rendering of the Japanese vinyl version of 1982, which in addition to a very good pressing, gives a very good result to the listening, and it is also, the vinyl of 1982 which gives the best results to the measurements in particular on the cleanliness of the response curve.

You can find [here](https://magicvinyldigital.net/2022/11/29/michael-jackson-thriller-full-review-vinyl-cd-cassette-sacd-mofi-releases-qobuz-tidal-amazon-music-sony-360-ra-from-1982-to-2022/) the 21 versions with all the measurements and the extracts to compare them.

audiophile,I‚Äôve used skull candy products in the past (years ago by now) I‚Äôve always liked them but I‚Äôm wondering if for the same price point skull candy buds can compete with airpod pros in terms of sound quality
audiophile,"Hello, I'm completely nooby in the audio topic, but would like to ask for some advice.

During Black Friday, I decided to update the very cheap computer speakers with something a bit better. So I saw some Polk XT15s on sale and bought them. Also chose the Fosi Audio BT20A amp as it looked solid and powerful enough for the basic passive speakers.

As result, I've got a pretty nice sounding setup, except absolutely no bass at any level on the amp and the equaliser.

So I ordered the bigger Polk XT20 and if I set up the equaliser to hip-hop and the maximum on the amp, they show some bass. But the overall sound quality became very muffled.

The bass appears only if I rise the volume to some extremely loud levels (70+ dB).

I also tried to move the speakers wider and place them on the table, moving the table. Then the bass disappears at all. Also BT, wired connection to MacBook air m1, wired connection to the monitor.

I was thinking to add the Polk XT12 sub, but then I need to return the amp and buy something which supports an active amp. So need some advice here. How can I get a good sound and some bass not only on the extremely high volume levels?

I also have a pair of basic Sonos Ones in my living room and they give a huge amount of bass in comparison with that useless huge Polks. Is it normal for the monitor speakers to have almost no bass until critical levels of volume without a sub?

Thanks!

audiophile,"I recently moved and I am only listening to music with the Klipsch Pro Media 2.0 speakers and I am becoming depressed with the fact that often times I am only hearing half of the sound in most modern music I hear. I enjoy dubstep, grime, trap, and other various genres of EDM!

They are slightly enjoyable when the music has no sub frequencies but, they still lack that big sound such as when using my Denon running my Snell Towers and Acoustic Research Sub.

My question is, What percentage of music, on average, do you not hear when your sound system will not play anything below 70Hz?"
audiophile,Correct me if Im wrong but impedance is AC reistance so since were talking about DC devices we shouldnt use the term impedance

I‚Äôm hoping to get 2 sets of the Edifier R1280DBs, so 4 speakers total. Looking to have 2 of them in my living room and then the other 2 in my bedroom.

Edifier does not offer the option to link one set with another and I would like to be able to play to all 4 at once using bluetooth. Obviously, running all 4 to a bluetooth receiver is certainly an option but I would like to avoid having snaking wires going from living room to bedroom. Is there a way to make all 4 linked together so I can just connect to one bluetooth connection and then play to all 4?

Never really gotten into home audio before and don‚Äôt know what is good or bad like car speakers and such. What speakers and sub or even two if it would make it sound better, along with an amp or two would y‚Äôall recommend.

audiophile,"I find myself rather surprised when looking through a post I recently made regarding the 2022 release of \*Supergrass\* by Supergrass. The release is billed as a ""remaster"", but the audio is identical, save for the start times of songs being slightly different. To be clear, I mean, the audio is literally IDENTICAL; summing the 1999 US master and a polarity-inverted version of the 2022 ""remaster"" results in complete silence.

Would it be fair then to even call it a remaster? I find it tantamount to lying by calling it a remaster at that point, because I feel the colloquial definition of remastering involves editing the music with EQ, compression, and the like. I understand that mastering engineers do more than editing the music, including making it suitable for commercial release, but that's not really my point. My issue is billing something as a ""remaster"" specifically.

To further clarify my position, *√Åg√¶tis byrjun* by Sigur R√≥s was reissued two years back and had the same EQing and compression as the original release to my knowledge, but I didn't have an issue with it because it didn't claim to be a remaster. 

What do you all think?"

audiophile,"A few weeks ago I bought [this handy little tool](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093GSS8P7?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) \- a simple switch that enables me to switch between two different amps into the same set of speakers, or switch between two sets of speakers hooked up to the same amp. Today I conducted a set of A/B tests between the three power amps I own: a Pioneer Spec 2, a [Class D Audio Mini GaN 5](https://classdaudio.com/mini-gan-5-balanced-power-amplifier.html), and an Adcom GFA-2535.

For the tests I used 2 identical Sonos Connects as the sources - one connected to each amp in the test. This enabled me to cue up the same song across the two amps at identical places in the song, and at identical volumes. No preamp was used - the Connects were wired directly into the RCA inputs on the amps.

The speakers used were my Joseph Audio RM7SI's, the best pair I own.

I listened to a variety of music including acoustic singer-songwriter, rock, and jazz - the three genres I listen to almost exclusively.

My wife did the A/B switching.

Perhaps not a perfect blind A/B test, but as close as I think I can get.

As the subject says, the results surprised me. There was zero difference between the three. If it weren't for a slight clicking noise when my wife switched from A to B and back, I wouldn't even have known I was listening to different amps. My expectation going into the test was that the Spec 2 would dominate, the GaN would come in second but sound colder and more clinical than the Spec, and the Adcom would come in last but hold its own as a budget amp. That wasn't the case at all - they were literally indistinguishable. In fact, at one point, I had to pause the test to go respond to an email at my desk, and the music continued playing. Mid-email I shouted, ""DAMN THIS SOUNDS FANTASTIC!!!"" I asked my wife which amp was playing - it was the Adcom.)

So what it comes down to for me is: 

* The Spec 2 is the most beautiful of the three and has the most cache - it will generate the most oooh's and aaah's when you're showing off your system. (Note that my Spec hasn't been rebuilt, so admittedly that could also be coloring the results.)
* The GFA-2535 is a fantastic budget amp that can be had all day long for \~$200-$300 on the used market. Its also very versatile in that it can be used in 2, 3, or 4 channel configurations - really good for home theater use.
* And the GaN is tiny, generates no heat, and has no moving parts so it's dead silent and easy to hide  wherever your system is installed (both the Adcom and Spec are older and have transformers that are now making a slight buzz - and it drives me crazy when my audio equipment makes noise.) 

I would have liked to continue the test with the native Class D amps in my Denon 3700 HTR, and the amp in my vintage Nikko NR-1019 receiver, but I got lazy - it would have been pretty invasive and a lot of work to pull them out of the shelves where I have them installed. I also wish I had an uber high end amp to test in this fashion - maybe something with blue VU meters that light up. As a next step I think I'm going to pick up a cheap Chi-Fi amp on Amazon and replicate the test.

audiophile,Which of the two speakers would you get if sound quality and decent soundstage was important. I also like the speakers in which I can hear all instrument details loud and clear along with decent sound stage.
audiophile,"So I'm using this new voice changer that is in alpha that is just * cheff kiss * good. It's something I wouldn't have thought would have reached consumers especially in a live decently low latency (1-5 secs) mode.

It's not perfect at certain targets, you kinda can play around with something like the politician or celebrity voices somewhat for fun and games.

But it shines at making you sound either a different male voice or a female voice. I would say it's closer to 90%+ credible. Very few users will go ""You are using some sort of voice changer or TTS!"".

**The problem is the output is too clean**. Making the imperfections stand out, think of any AI voice cloning stuff you have seen (if you have) and how they're very close but have quirks, pitch issues and certain roboticness coming through.

I got the idea because when I connected the voice changer to the game MWII it sounded lower quality and it freaking killed, closer to near 100% credibility, the bad quality sounded like the typical console mic and it shrouded/camouflaged the imperfections.

**So expanding and summing up the issue:**

I cannot lower the quality at any point of the processing queue except the very end:

My condenser mic  &gt; AI voice &gt; VB cable &gt; Game (this is where the quality can be messed with).

Because of the importance of audio you send to the voice changer I cannot mess with the input in anyway.

Feel free to suggest any weird/more complicated solutions. I'm actually swithing to a dual PC setup real soon because the resources taken by the AI voice changer are around 15-30% of GPU/CPU. Meaning that at one point my main PC will receive the processed ""final"" audio through the line in of main PC."
audiophile,"Hello audiophile Reddit. I recently purchased a pair of Mcintosh WS350 in wall speakers to pair with my Mcintosh MA6100 amplifier. 

Now, I know my amp is very underpowered for these speakers, which is why I have an Anthem MCA 20 amplifier on the way. I have a sliver of hope that it will help my problem, but doubtful after last nights listening. 

I‚Äôve had these for about 4 months but never cranked them too high until now. The speakers sound great at low-medium volume, but if I turn it up to higher volumes, the 4‚Äù minds start popping. At first I thought it was the amp clipping, but it really seems like the speakers are blown. When I gently push on the speaker cones during low volume playback, the sound starts to scratch. Woofers and tweeters all sound fine at higher volumes. 

So basically, if it turns out a new power amp doesn‚Äôt help, where is a reputable place to look for genuine replacements, or repair for Mcintosh speakers? Preferably in Canada.

I honestly regret buying these speakers used now. Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions."

audiophile,"Not sure if this would be the right place to ask for help. I run a sim racing rig and have two Dayton BST1 transducers attached to it. I needed an amp to power these, I originally went with a nobsound mini but returned it as it didn't have enough power to push the Daytons as much as I wanted. I got an Aiyima A07 from Amazon and it just arrived, however I'm having an issue with the transducers cutting off for a few seconds when I have the amp over like 50% volume. It will stop moving the BST1s for like 5 seconds then cut back on. If I turn the volume down more it runs pretty consistently. I was using a home stereo system to power them while I was waiting on this amp to get in, and didn't have this issue with that or the Nobsound.

Do I have a faulty amp? Or something not correct here? The amp is pretty basic, power, speakers, and volume.

I'm using a Apple USB c to 3.5 DAC from my PC, then a 3.5 to RCA cable to connect to amp.

Let me know if there's anything I should try or just return and try another amp"

audiophile,"Morning, all.

I'm seeking suggestions/recommendations to better integrate a pair of subs into my system. The base system consists of:

Turntable -&gt; phono stage -&gt; 300B P/P monoblocks -&gt; speakers

Previously I had split the RCA out from the phono stage (which has built-in volume control, so that's where that happens) and run one r/L branch to the sub where it's combined @ the sub, and the other r/L branch to the respective monoblock. This worked, but I wanted to even things out a little bit and send low end on the R channel to a R sub, and from the L channel to a L sub. So I purchased a matching sub to even things out. I obviously can continue doing things the way I was before, but instead of both r/L going to one sub each line goes to the corresponding sub in the new setup.

But it feels that there's likely a better way to do it. Would I be better adding an active splitter to maintain signal level instead of passively dividing it? Or possibly adding an active crossover and sending everything above the crossover point to the monoblocks and below to the subs?

Actual gear:

Turntable: Dual 1019  
Phono Stage: Moscode SuperIT  
Monoblocks: Hand wired 300B Push-Pull by Deja Vu Audio  
Speakers: DCM Time Frame 600  
Subs: B&amp;W ASW300"
audiophile,"People with high end setups, what do you use as your digital source?
Do you just plug your phone into your DAC using a USB cable, or do you have some mini PC/NAS specifically for music?"
audiophile," 

1. Cable connection

I got a pair of E5 XTs, Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 and 2 unbalanced TS to XLR cables for Black Friday from a local shop. It was a bit of a hasty buy and I was busy for a couple of days, but now its settling in and Im wondering, should I have gotten the balanced TRS to XLR instead? Ive called them to ask if I can swap, they said they have to check if they even have 1.5m balanced cables and that for that short of a distance theres really no difference. Can someone confirm this?

I should mention that I didnt specifically ask for unbalanced cables, thats just what they gave me and in the heat of the moment I didnt think to check every stat.

2. EQ setup.

Ive set the Acoustic Space setting to -2dB as my desk is right up against the wall and thats the recommended setting for such a setup. The monitors themselves arent up against the wall tho, theres about 15cm of space between the wall and the back of the monitors. Is this the correct setting? I can tell the bass is lacking compared to my cheap Genius 2.1 setup that had a woofer. Whats the point of this setting anyway? Low Cutoff is on flat btw.

And what are the best settings for gain and mids/highs? Ive set mine as: Gain: 13 o'clock, mid: 12, high: 13.

Whats the difference between setting the gain on the monitor and controlling the volume with the Scarlett's volume knob?

3. Audio/video stream play delay.

Theres a very slight delay when I press play on any audio/video stream with this setup compared to the previous Genius speakers which connected through the speaker out jack on my PC motherboard. Is this inevitable?

Ive tried every sampling rate and buffer size setting, its still there. It was instantaneous previously. I understand that theres processing time with digital interfaces compared to an analog jack, but can it be made better? My job involves checking a lot of video streams in quick succession and that microdelay really adds up and annoys me to the point I have to switch to my screen's speakers to complete that task.

Thank you."
audiophile,"I just bought a pair of Borea BR03 passive speakers and a Fosi amp, however I realised the Fosi amp only has RCA and my TV has an optical input.

audiophile,Got any mod ideas for taming a 3k peak on an iem? Iem is a Shuoer Tape.
audiophile,"Firstly, apologies for poor descriptions that follow, I really don't know what I'm talking about. And overall I'm really happy with the set up (probably because I don't know any better). But I just want to get a gage for the good, the bad, and if i do want to improve where the first place to start would be both in upgrading tech, and just trying out changes to speaker positioning or settings.  And things like is it bad to have my speakers stacked ect.

The turntable is a Kenwood kp-2022. Bought second hand probably 10 years ago from a guy that serviced it and put a new needle on it. 

The amp is a JVC JA-S31 that puts out 40w per channel. My dad bought this more me about 8 years ago and had been serviced before sale. 

Speakers on system one are a pair of Pioneer scs-11 speakers. On the back of each they say their max input is 18w (does this mean the 40w output from the amp is being spilt across both speakers on this system?) 

Speakers on system two are a pair of AWA se-24A speakers. Don't know anything about them outside of that. 

I usually play both systems at once. I would describe system one (pioneer) as having a clearer/cleaner sound but favours vocals and lacks a bit of depth. System two (awa) feels like the opposite, where a lot of the background instruments and rhythm sections come forward but the vocals get pushed back. This second system does get an underlying hum that is mostly audible during song breaks but is also definitely there when standing close to the system during songs to. Nothing world breaking though. Together I feel like they find a good balance and I usually set the tome control to bass 2+ and Treble 0. 
I only ever need to play music at around a 3 or 4 (max) volume to fill the room and the neighbouring rooms of the house. And at level 2 if I'm sitting on the couch right in front of it. Anything 5 or over and I feel like would be damaging the speakers."

audiophile,Any decent cyber Monday deals for home studio recording headphones? Not well versed enough to know what companies to avoid etc..
audiophile,"I‚Äôve seen a lot of good debate on lossless vs mp3 vs vinyl and the debates on expensive cables, amps and dacs. Some arguing that even cheap dacs have no influence on the sound and that a 44khz 16 bit playback technology can never be topped because of the limitations of human hearing. I‚Äôve also seen some argue that sound quality is now entirely limited by speaker design and room acoustics. Most experiments I have read about involved ABX testing on low quality mp3, high quality mp3, and flac. I am unaware of any blind experiments where they have found people that can repeatedly tell a difference between mp3 and some higher quality medium. This got me thinking and wondered if anyone has been in a mixing room either at a live show or radio station and could tell the difference between a live performance and a replay of it later on? The idea would be to test the limitations of recording technology because the live and recorded show would have been played on the same studio equipment. Perhaps it just doesn‚Äôt work this way, as perhaps the equipment is entirely separate? I would suggest if one couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between a live performance and it‚Äôs recording, in this type of setting, that would indicate that a live show sounds so much better almost entirely because of the volume and room. If the difference is obvious that wouldn‚Äôt mean playback equipment isn‚Äôt important, but that the source (live vs cd) is an important factor. In which case I would ask, what about the recording capability is the limiting factor (ie microphone capabilities)?
My original idea was to propose a setup where someone would play live music in a soundproof room.  This would be fed to a mid-level sound system in a listeners house and they would do a blind A/B test of live vs recorded. Then substitute in a high end DAC, then expensive cables each as a blind a/b test.  This isn‚Äôt of course feasible, so I feel like my radio station idea is the closest and it‚Äôs very common for them to have live guest on the air.

My question comes down to what can be improved in the audio chain? In this case I am using live music as the gold standard, but this doesn‚Äôt always have to be the case.

Perhaps there have been similar experiments that I am unaware of."

I mainly use my heapdhones for late night watching of movies and such. My plan was to plug my headphones into my Amp, then from the Amp into the Headphone Out port. 

This is what I did and they sound fantastic to me. The vocals are so much cleaner than any other headphones I've tried.  The bass boost option on the A5 also brightens up the low end, and well you know, whatever sounds good to you, audio is subjective and all that.

The A/V Receiver is a Denon X3500H. When I told my friend who is audiophile himself, he got very irate, saying I was double amping, causing double the noise and could damage the amps. They sound wonderful to me, but googling has lead me to no clear result on this matter.

The reason I am not heading the base headphone out without an Amp is because I had heard they were lower quality on these and introduced noise and such. 

His recommendation is 3.5mm to RCA and use the lineout on the back. However, what I love about the Headphone out is easy of use. Just plug it in, my speakers are muted and my headphones are a go. I've never used Line Out's before, they're on the back of my Receiver in a place a little annoying to get to, so if I had to plug them in and out each time, that'd be kind of annoying. 

How does it work in such a situation? He's never had an AVR apparently, so he doesn't know. He thinks it'd just play sound from both sources, which is not ideal, so before I drop like 8$(I know, really nothing), on a RCA cable, I just wanted opinions."
audiophile,"Hi everyone!

I'm gonna start this post by saying that this is my first post here, and I hardly ever use reddit, so apologies if I'm breaking any reddiquette with this post.

As the title suggests, I am looking for a DAC to pair in my music setup. I am a budding audiophile with little experience with audio equipment and trying to get my feet wet with separates. My current setup is a pair of Klipsch KLF-10's ($300) being driven by a vintage Pioneer SA-950 ($80 with a few other toys, 70 WPC solid state amp). These speakers are heavenly. I've laid out in front of them for hours at a time just listening to different songs, which is something I've never done before. I have a Reisong A10 tube amp coming in the mail on Dec. 1, which I paid $400 for. My primary source for Audio is a Echo dot, connected directly to my amp, with a pioneer turntable occasionally substituting it. Hoping to get an echo link for Christmas to make full use of my Amazon music HD account. 

So I am looking for a DAC that fits the rest of the Audio gear. I know I could pick any one and try it out, but I was hoping some people with experience could help point me in a good starting direction. I don't need a ton of extra features, just a good quality DAC to get the most of these speakers. I plan on upgrading to KLF-20's down the line and potentially eventually Cornwall IV's, though that will probably be a while, and I'd like gear that could suite those upgrades as well. I have heard great things about the schiit modi 3, though some people report that they have experience audio cutting in and out. For $150-200 it seems like a great option from everything I've read, but I know I'm the type of guy to get the ""upgrade bug"" and will probably spend more on a better one anyway. So to avoid that, I'd like to just skip to the next level DAC from the beginning. I was looking at the SMSL SU-9, on sale for $390 right now, but I'd be willing to stretch my budget up to around $500 if it offers some level of upgrade-proofing. Any great deals/DACs just outside that price range are welcome too, and any advice is appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for a \~$400-500ish DAC to pair with Echo Dot/Echo Link, and Reisong A10 EL34 tube amp to drive Klipsch KLF-10/20/cornwalls"
audiophile,"Hello everyone, I am wondering if there is a big audible difference between the Genelec 8351A and the newer 8351B. Of course stats indicate a difference, but I am specially interested in people who heard both of them. Do you really recognize the new tweeter? Thanks in Advance"
audiophile,"I have a Marshall Mode Wired earphones but the wires have already flayed (?) but the earphones still works. 
Should I have it re-wired or is the audio quality of a Marshall Mode not worth restoring for?"
audiophile,"I've been running 5.1 for about a year now, give or take. I don't really have the space or weight allowance for an actual quality setup. I'm in a 30 foot camper. I know the best answer would be to bigger, better, get a tower, etc...but that would make a moderate problem a bad one.

As it stands, I have two speakers basically next to the couch I sit on, (could be worked under, or up, but probably not behind) and two front speakers more or less maybe 6-7ft away and in a cabinet probably not far enough away from each other. Hidden in a piece of furniture beneath and center to them is my center.


So here we go...

What's a good pickup, in 2022, for mini bookshelf speakers? If I HAVE TO, I can make smaller bookshelf speakers work, possibly on their side. Likewise, what about center? Is a soundbar only to make a TV sound better than normal integrated speaker? And is any small subwoofer worth it? (Maybe 8-12 inches cube?) Figure one of the ones that kicks straight down would be best here, but know nothing about subs.

Currently I have two semi-decent at best up front, and two pretty not great speakers for rear and Center. To be fair, the center does a decent job of making up for no sub, and has pretty clear treble for dialogue but fails pretty hard outside of that.

Currently thinking of starting perhaps with 2x Micca RB42, at which point I'd really like two minis for behind, and a good center/sub option (again smaller the better on the sub, and wider and flatter better for center.) 

Thanks for any advice or input! Can take pictures if it helps.

Whatever I get or y'all recommend, it's fine, but I'd live either

A) Solid all rounders in the used market to look out for, for the steal of a deal ( got a friend with some paradigm towers I LOVE but don't recall the model. I think even the bookshelves are hard to find lol. From what I understand this is tricky since it will vary by model and declining quality even within same models over generations?

B) Something I can continue to integrate further with, or will still be a good choice later on in a better environment. 

Style is good if possible, I'd prefer black, wood, white, matte, or some mix like white+pine, but doesn't really matter in the end.

Budget roughly 200-300 per pair ideally. If it's better to say, jump to 500 and take it slow, let me know.

I don't need anything mind blowing. I don't think I'm a true ""audiophile"" but I DO appreciate good/better sound. I can't stand muddy, tinny, flat, etc. I just want something clear, warmer, with good soundstage for the size. If the mids are clear enough, the bass is present and good enough (obv at the size there will probably be a dropoff, and lacking reproduction and probably bad extension and distortion at higher volumes and that's okay I'm not trying to rock the block here) and the treble is best, that would be good."
audiophile,"My extensive googling over the past few days has not yielded many results. I even went back through my google history for the past eight months.

But I‚Äôm hopping at least one of you also read the same thing and were smart enough to save it or at least  remember what I‚Äôm talking about. 

The speakers themselves were very simple. They were a single driver design, with a gray ‚Äúfaux‚Äù wood finish (may be real wood). They were skinny but deep. (Some of my early searches turned the Credo EV reference review from part-time audiophile, but they aren‚Äôt gray). A similar appearance to the Credo‚Äôs, but shorter. 

The review of the speakers was very similar to many speakers reviews. About how the speakers specific toe in and distance from the wall. The main difference from other reviews is the author talked about how the speakers needed a break in period, to ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù. And how they sounded good with out filling the base with sand but were improved with the base filled. 

I know this isn‚Äôt a lot to definitively go on but the other details I‚Äôm not 100% on. Originally I thought the review contained some of the music the author listened to (alt-j and solo drumming, but those are from an amp review on twittering machines), maybe the review were around the same time.

My seating position is just a-little over half way back lengthwise, leaving about 6 feet behind me to place the subwoofer. I‚Äôm looking at an RSL Speed-woofer 10S MKii or SB1000 based on bang for buck. Paired to Qacoustics M20 HD(like 3020i but powered) would this just simply be overkill? Would a small 8‚Äù sub for half the price suffice?"
audiophile,"I am looking to buy wharfedale linton speakers and would like to know if I can use my amplifier with them.
I own an old NAD c320. The lintons are rated at 6ohm and minimal impedance 3.5ohm.
Can I pair them? Or should I buy another higher rated amp? If so, what would you recommend?"
audiophile,"I‚Äôve got these old Pioneer speakers that came from my folks‚Äô old home theatre system that I was hoping to hook up to a new receiver that I‚Äôve got in my bedroom, but it has this safety warning not to use the speakers with any other amp. The only connection is through speaker wire, I might be dumb to say this cos I‚Äôm still pretty new with audio but I would‚Äôve thought something as simple as speaker wire would be completely universal among systems and pose zero risk to these passive speakers with other amps. Is it possible that this was simply put in as a means of keeping all replacement purchases of individual parts within the pioneer system? Or should I actually refrain from connecting these with my new receiver?"
audiophile,"I‚Äôm looking for the best headphones in Audi quality and comfort under 200, the Sony.   WH-XB-910n seem good but I need more options. I also want it to have decent battery life and a somewhat sleek design but that‚Äôs not as important"
audiophile,"I often have friends asking me what the difference is between analog and digital music. And the technical answer would be the analog is more pressure controlling sounds, which digital is 1010... But this is not very intuitive for people who haven't studied computers, and it certainly doesn't explain ""how"" different they sound.

In circumstances where you can't just play them music from the two different sources, how would you explain the difference?"
audiophile,i can‚Äôt find any wires longer than 1.2 meters i have a long desk and my pc is quite a distance away. does anyone know where i can get long wires. i thought about getting a 3.5mm extension but will that add latency to the sound? i‚Äôm using these for gaming so that‚Äôs a big no.
audiophile,"Hey all -- I recently purchased a FiiO M11 Plus ESS for my first DAP (other than a few iPods) and was intrigued by the inclusion of balanced PO/LO connectors. Since I currently own Etymotics ER3XR IEMs, and seeing as they had a 2.5mm balanced cable available, I went ahead picked that up as well. As I am enjoying the reduced/complete lack of noise and enhanced clarity (especially as I mostly listen to film/classical music) I don't have any over-ear hadphones that support balanced (2.5/4.4mm) connections and so was interested in seeing what might be well recommened, given the deals for headphones going on. I prefer listining on studio monitor-type headphones, as i prefer the overall neutral sound, and would like to use them for music creation (composition/mixing) as well as general listening; I grew up using the Sony MDR-V6s and love the clarity and soundstage, and presenly use the MDR-7506s. (I also had a pair of Sony MH750 earbuds before getting the Etymotics and very much enjoyed their sound.)

Hoping I can get some recomendation while the deals are hot. Appreciate the help!"
audiophile,"Hi there. First off, I'm a total newbie when it comes to anything audio related, so please excuse my total lack of knowledge. :)
I've recently moved into my first home. It has 5 built in wall speakers and I have no clue how to operate it. I'd assume I'd need some sort of a receiver or amplifier? For reference, the house was built in 1996. Any input would be appreciated!
1)what are those gray wires? Are each of the wires for each pair of the wall speakers with left and right wires?
2)what is the black box that the wires are attached to?
3)what additional equipment do I need to get the speakers going? Amplifier? Receiver? Any equipment recommendations?
4)would it be easy to upgrade in the future with different in wall speakers?
Thank you!"
audiophile,"Currently running an AT-lpw40wn with a grado gold cart, a parks audio budgie and some adam a7x speakers. Just realized that one of my A7x‚Äôs has a blown tweeter. Looking to replace them with something different. I was thinking about going the passive/amp driven route for listening since i dont really do much mixing anymore. Looking to spend &lt;2k on both the speakers and the amp. Any recommendations?"
audiophile,It bloody scares me when I turn on my nice speakers to listen to this new song and I hear all these artifacts. I take the covers off and put on my reference song while I panic trying to figure out what's going on. Maybe its slight cracking from on part in the song. It makes my heart jump. Even once I figure out it's just the song I still feel panicked.
audiophile,"I always wondered about this. 

when I was playing around, doing this and that with my first iPad (it was the first 11inch pro model)
the first thing that came up to my mind was its sound quality.

before using that iPad, speakers in tablet PCs were generally bad; or at least I believed so.

nowadays I am pretty sure that lots (if not all) of people using the iPad pro have agreed on the fact that iPad speakers are good in general.

everytime i ask someone ""how good is an iPad's speaker compared to headphones or earbuds?""
they're all just saying 'iPad Pro speakers are in fact very good and underrated', 
'speakers are mostly about size, so even if a tablet PC has a good speaker it's only as good as its size'

so it got me thinking, is iPad speaker really good, so good that it is better than some headphones or earbuds(airpods for instance)

what do you think? please share an opionion."
audiophile,Or does just a hdmi 2.1 from the receiver to the tv suffice? Because the receiver can handle 4k 120hz but if I need two cords when I‚Äôm only using one then I‚Äôd be wasting high quality eye candy and nobody wants that lol.
audiophile,"alright... so im looking for a double 1/4 to banana plug cable and it does not seem to exist.

So far my options to substitute that (assuming it doesnt exist.) are having a shit ton of adaptor cables connecting my amplifier to my peavey speakers, or getting a 1/4 male head and soldering on my own wire.

audiophile,I just set up the Wiim Mini player and I‚Äôm having a small problem. It only plays in 44.1 kHz even though when I set it up for 24/96 it plays the test noise in 96. But when I play music through either the Qobuz app or through the Wiim app it only plays 44.1. What am I doing wrong here?
audiophile,"First of all sorry if I get things mixed up, I've been reading a lot lately and I don't quite understand all of it... I wanted to offer myself a nice HiFi set-up for xmas so I'm into buying a pair of Klipsch RP-280F speakers and I struggle to find the correct amplifier to drive them. My room size is around 30 squared meters (flat), rectangle shaped and I'll be listening at 3m from the speakers.  


**Speakers RP-280F spec:**  
\- sensibility: 98 dB (2,83 V at 1 m)  
\- power: 150 W RMS / 600 W peak  
\- impedance 8 ohm  
**Receiver PMA-900HNE spec:**  
\- Output power 4 Ohm (1 kHz, T.H.D. 0.7%): 85W + 85W  
\- Output power 8 Ohm (20 Hz - 20 kHz, T.H.D. 0.07%): 50W + 50W  
\- Power Amplifier Circuit: Advanced High Current Single Push-Pull Circuit  


It appears that the receiver is very underpowered, right? Nevertheless it has lots of features I would like to have (wireless connections, streaming capabilities, DAC chip) and a fair price. More powerfull receivers lack these features and are very costly. I've read that under-powering could damage the speaker because of the ""clipping"" effect (which I don't really understand). **Will it be the case with this combination?**

**If yes then what should I buy?** Should I add a Denon PMA-1600NE and make it a trio? Are there other devices/brands that I could pair with a more powerful amp in order to have the same functionalities but correctly drive the speakers?

Thank a lot for your knowledge !"

audiophile,"I've narrowed my selection down to these three..

- NAD C316BEE V2 

- Yamaha AS-301

All brand new. All under $600 AUD. All have different strengths and weaknesses.

 I don't know if I'd consider myself an ""audiophile"", more of a ""HiFi Enthusiast"", that's why I'm posting here, I want to here from you all. Which of these amps would you buy? Or do you have another option you could recommend me? Must be under $600 AUD. Must be able to be bought domestically. 

It'll be driving a set of Jensen System 500 speakers. And on the input side, a turntable, a chromecast audio and at some stage a CD player. The Chromecast Audio will likely be plugged into a DAC Magic over Toslink if the NAD or Cambridge come out on top, the Yamaha has a DAC built in. 

Thanks for your help. I'm really having a hard time deciding what to get. I unfortunately don't have the ability to A B C compare them in person. 

Any advice is helpful.

I'm mostly looking for something that can function as a preamp/headphone amp, with similar I/O to something like a Magni, but I also like the idea of a 6-10w Class A amp that will handle everything from headphones, bookshelf speakers, and a couple inputs for my DAC and turntable.

My budget is 500$ or less, and, despite all the features I'd like, I want the best tube sound I can afford for this price. I'm willing to forgo pretty much all features in favor of better sound.

audiophile,"I  used my Audio Technica LP5X for the first time today. Needle, pressure,  anti-skating and co are of course adjusted. Previously I had a  belt-driven Sony from the 80s which could not be adjusted at all.

For  the test I put on the Foo Fighters - ""Greatest Hits"" and especially  with ""The Pretender"" I notice quite a bit of overdrive. This does not  sound like a deliberate overdrive of the guitars but rather a compressed  clipping. I find this hard to describe. I never noticed this before  with the same headphones (Sony WH-1000XM3) or speakers (Magnat All  Ribbon 5) when listening on Spotify or MP3.

Is  this the issue with the loudness war that everyone is talking about? I  haven't noticed it with other albums (e.g. Green Day - Dookie).  Therefore I rather exclude technical problems"

audiophile,"I am looking to add a speaker switch to my system so that all of my rooms aren't running at the same time. 

My question is; if I run the switch off of just the front channel am I going to lose power as opposed to using all three channels?

If so, should I look into a dual input switch so that I can have the front and rear outputs going into the switch? 

The receiver is a Denon AVR-5600 (single solid state amp). I understand that the amp can only put out what its rated for but fail to understand if the channels are limited. So, if I have 2 pairs on the front and two pairs on the rear, that's 140w to the front two pairs and 140w to the rear two pairs. But if I have 4 pairs on the front (via the switch) that's 140w to all 4 pairs (not taking impedance into account). 

Am I understanding this correctly?"

 The structure of the room is unique. The front walls are all glass (the glass is 8 cm thick) and beyond the glass there is a warehouse space.

I actually made 2x 5.1 kits. The first one was for practice. They still work great after almost 20 years.

The cost was 2K for the 2 kits (6X MTM - 4X TM) and 1.5k for the subs (2x). All around 3.5K CAD for a 10.2 sound system wood and glue excluded.

They're small, have tweeters, and are within my budget.

However, upon further investigation, I figured out that, the speakers (and probably the sub too) use speaker wire.  I know these types of speakers generally require an AMP, so I was wondering if I could get a sound card with a built-in Amplifier and use a 3.5mm Jack to speaker wire converter?

I set them up on stands in the exact same location I had the Paradigm towers and the first things I notice are the high frequency detail and how much fuller it sounded. I don't know how a smaller pair of speakers can sound better than tower speakers but I am impressed with how good they sound! Now I have 30 days to try them and decide whether to keep or return them. I still have a pair of Usher S-520 that I want to compare them to.

I would like to be able to play vinyl for serious listening sessions but also have the option to Bluetooth my phone and just play some music for day to day. This would all be played over speakers, not headphones. What kind of equipment should I be looking at to make this possible? Any suggestions on equipment to get something off the ground &lt; $500? or am I really just wasting money at that point and should wait and save up for something better?"
audiophile,"Hello audiophiles,

I am looking for some ‚Äúcheap‚Äù earphones with  decent sound quality as a pair that I want to use temporary, until the Bowers &amp; Wilkins PI7 s2 will come out.

Does someone know a pair that has a decent balanced HIFI sound? (24 bit 48khz) that is sold for around 50-75 dollars/euros? If it has the same sound as my PI7‚Äôs, that would be great! I Will be returning my pi7‚Äôs and need something for in between.

Would love to hear from you!"

Being a new vinyl collector/listener, these past few weeks have been pure bliss opening all my records and listening to each one. Instantly fell in love with how much effect I can have to my listening experience coming into this realm. Happy listening :)"

audiophile,The stereo receiver has an issue where the right right inputs on both Speaker A and B do not work correctly. One of the speakers always ends up being significantly quieter than the other. If you have any insight w fixing this please let me know. Otherwise I am looking for suggestions on a replacement stereo receiver.
audiophile,"I'm new to passive speakers. I wanted a small desktop speaker with good bass response and the Micca RB42 ticked all boxes.

I got the RB42 with a [FOSI BT30D](https://www.amazon.ca/BT30A-Sliver-Bluetooth-Audio-Amplifier-Integrated/dp/B07K7NJ4QN) and it sounded terrible - empty and lacking any substance.

Thinking it was a bad amp, I even bought a used SMSL AD-18 which seems to be well reviewed and recieved. It sounded just as bad as the FOSI Amp - empty and very little bass/mids. I tried connecting via the DAC and the 3.5mm jack.

I then hooked it up to my [Marantz NR1402](https://www.marantz.com/en-ca/product/av-receivers/nr1402) which I use for my TV. With the marantz, the RB42 sound incredible to me - probably the best sound I've ever heard out of desktop speakers.

My question is - Why aren't the desktop amps doing even a remotely good job. My AV receiver can only put out 75W, which is less than what the desktop amps are rated for, yet they sound absolutely terrible by comparison.

The speakers are clearly great, how do I properly drive them?"

audiophile,"I had purchased some Kali LP-6s last year. V1s. Now for reference, I have a full sound treated space. Roughly 20 cubic feet of corner trapping, and then 4 panels for early reflections. (Rockwool if you're wondering, extremely effective, and affordable)

So my bedroom is titted to the gills, and I noted that suddenly the LP-6s fully flat bass response to 40 hz was incredibly obnoxious. So during the last year, I sealed up the LP-6s, crossed them over at 70hz and introduced my old Natalie Ps to cover 70hz down to about 20 hz stereo.

So about a week ago, I purchased a LP-6 V2. Better High end, and the unported bass was amazing compared to my now docile LP-6 V1s.

So I unported my old pair, left them crossed over at 70 hz and Wow! Adding any more low-end to these monsters is just insane. They're nearly perfect. Great stereo field, silky smooth sound stage and they still pound.

So if you're looking for something a little different, the industry is pumping out powered monitors that are little monsters for a dime. You literally just have to tame the low end and you have a diamond in the rough."

audiophile,"Hello! So I got this headphones Sennheiser HD599 and Amp Qdelix-5K, been using it Bluetooth with the stock unbalanced cables, no issues, great sound and volume on my Samsung a52s, pixel 4a, Samsung J7 and Fire HD 10 tablet. 
Now I bought this $16  balanced cable that matches the headphones, and was under the impression that it would help increase volume even more. I thought volume and ""noise"" reduction was its main purpose. I don't have any electrical noise issues, but did want to give it more volume. Actually it does the opposite. The volume is half with the balanced cable. Am I missing something here, or is the cable a scam, fake one? I really don't need it for the HD599, but wanted to see how it works, but I just bought a Sennheiser HD 650 and will arrive next week, and since that's 300 omh I think I might need more volume. I see some back balanced cables behind sold for these headphones on Amazon.

audiophile,"Hey there, does anyone have experience with old vintage speakers that have domes with ferrofluid in it? 

I have my old Acron b900 and I love them. They are special managoni edition with chassis in Champaign metal and they sound and look just wonderful. 
I just know that they could sound better, because I had a modified black version earlier that just was a bit more forward and detailed. 
I know that my speakers are over 40 years old, so I called a company to get the ferrofluid in mid and high range domes replaced and to get an overhaul. They told me they just cannot overhaul the domes, they need to fix the crossover also, consequentially because the balance has to be checked after dome refurbushment. Fine so far, but their price point starts at 1500‚Ç¨ (I paid 800‚Ç¨ for the speakers) which includes a made to measure crossover, new terminals and cabling. I just don‚Äôt know how much snake oil could be involved here. I could also pay more (up to 15000‚Ç¨) for even better parts or a symmetrical crossover. I know that a crossover can make a big difference but I‚Äôm also afraid that it could destroy the original sound of the speakers that I love. Does anyone have any experience?

Thanks!"

My dad recommended the Fisher MT-6225 turntable and wow was I blown away with it
connected to my klipsch surround system.

I was able to get this turntable with everything original down to the box and manuals in the box. The seller was awesome and took the original box, and placed in a bigger box to ship. I saved the original box and everything that came inside. Wow was things packed better back then.

Really love this turntable, the sound is very warm with the original needle.

I am blown away at the sound quality from this turntable"
audiophile,"Helle all, about a year ago, i decided to invest in a total upgrade/overhaul of my vinyl setup.  I went from a solid Project turntable, preamp, and Edifier-powered speakers.  The setup was great but it was not powerful and loud enough so I gifted it to my equally vinyl-obsessed neighbor.  I'm actually jealous of how great it sounds in her smaller space.

Factors to consider:

* I have to have an EQ.  I like the extra control, and I have vinyl of varying quality and age, and want the ability to make them all sound great.
* I live in a large, open space loft, so the setup is ina designated listening area with chairs.  I have no complaints about the sound when I'm sitting dead center, and frankly, it sounds good throughout the house when I'm cleaning, etc.
* All of my equipment sits atop a console, and the amp, power conditioner, and EQ are stacked with he turntable about 12"" away.

Equipment:

* Musical Fidelity M5si 150 Watt Integrated Amplifier
* KLH Model 5 Speakers on stands
* Pro-Ject X2 Turntable on solid walnut plinth
* Furman PL-8C Advanced Power Level Conditioner.

Connecton Flow:

* Turntable =&gt; Equalizer =&gt; MF Amp
* The turntable is grounded to the amp, and all components are plugged into the Furman, which is plugged directly into the wall.

Physical Arrangment:

* Stack 1 (top to bottom)
   * EQ
   * Furman
   * Amp
* Stack 2
   * Turntable, same console, about 12"" to the right

Challenges

* EQ Hum - I have tried a few EQ's with varying levels of success
   * Schiit Loki Mini+ 4 Band Tone Equalizer - Hum hum hum.  
   * Rockville Audio Req 42-B x 2 21-band EQ - Hum hum hum.
   * Bellari Audio EQ 570 Audio Equalizer - Actually works well with no hum, or very minimal (doesn't bother me), BUT I want more control.  

The Rockville model has the control that I want, but the hum is the worst.  

Feedback Requested:

* General overall equipment feedback and overall setup - could the physical stacks and proximity be causing the problem?
* Ground Loops:  I have read about these a ton but they are like offsides in soccer.  Might this be the issue, and if so, can you help me fix it (like I'm a kindergartner)?
* Cables: I've bought shielded cables, but no dice.  Thoughts?

Appreciate that I'm a bit of a novice but I did a ton of research and am disappointed that the cheapest EQ with the least flexibility works the best in my system.  

Thanks in advance!"
audiophile,"Hello I am looking into buying a 5.1 surround sound system for my tv and it is Bluetooth which the TV has Bluetooth but is there such a thing as a box to connect all speakers with a wired connection if they have 3.5mm ports as well as my iRocker speaker then use just one cable to connect it back to my tv?

audiophile,"Hi, as you can see my speaker placement isn't great right now due to the room specifics etc. At present my speakers are connected with think chunky speaker cables hidden behind the cupboard, but to get to the right triangle one of the speakers (yellow arrow) needs to move to the other side of the room (blue arrow). So i am looking for discreet high quality speaker cables that i can either run along the skirting boards behind the sofa or up to the ceiling over and down again. 

I can't move any of the furniture around to the various needs of the room aside from my listening sanctuary (guest bedroom, office etc).

Immensly grateful for any recommendations. Thank you.

audiophile,"I currently use Audirvana to stream local music to my amp (Cambridge Audio CX80) via a iFi Zen Stream connected to a Topping E50 Dac.  I love the quality but recently I've been having issues where Audirvana Remote has stopped working on Android owing to a technical issue with newer Android OSes.  This morning I installed BubbleUPNP on my phone and whilst it can't see Audirvana, it can see when music is streaming to the iFi and control the iFi instead of Audirvana.  

In BubbleUPNP I am also able to see my Plex Server and the music files I serve it for Plexamp purposes.  Using Plex via UPNP, I can actually control all of my music and stream via UPNP at the correct Bitrates (up to DSD256) to my amp.  Both Bubble UPNP and the DAC report the correct Bitrates.  I was under the impression that Plex transcoded but when I look at PlexDash, it says nothing is playing.... Therefore I am assuming that Plex can now UPNP BitPerfect and this is a much cheaper way to stream local music than using Audirvana or Roon....

Is anyone else using Plex to UPNP their music in a similar and have you found any difference in sound quality?"

The seller does not have the **original ELAC bolts** for the stands. Anyone know how I can get the specific/correct bolts for these? Of course I need the correct length, thread, and taper. 

 Also, the **grilles are missing**. I almost never these *with* the grilles, but any chance there's someone out there that reproduces or copies the originals? I cannot pay like $200 for grilles, but if they function the same, it would be nice.

audiophile,"

Hi folks, I got the Q Acoustics 3020i some time back. It's powered by an SMSL DA9, amplifying from the line out of a might FiiO K3. I'm getting a super lovely soundstage and imaging, and I couldn't believe speakers could do that so well, my Sundara has taken a back seat now. In all honesty, I'm very very impressed and happy with my setup (sometimes I crave to try a DAC more from the mid-range, but resisting the financial plunge on that).

One thing I find I could definitely, definitely improve is the low-end punch, and hence the search for a good subwoofer. I'm trying to keep the budget low, and have been scanning around for a good while here in India. I have my eyes on the Q Acoustics 3060s (35k INR), QB-12 (69k INR) and the SVS-PB1000 (69k INR).

My office area is a small space, and is mostly going to be relatively small in the future too. I am looking for supple, clear bass, and nothing earth shattering. The main use would be for music, sometimes some games, and very very rarely, movies (those go on the TV). Also, only for the SVS, I could find a frequency response chart. If someone can help me with it, that would be great.

My thoughts are as follows:
Bic America F12: Good option in a budget, but I've heard quite a bit of reliability issues, and suggested to look otherwise and to other brands. The PL-200ii also, is a bit of a stretch, but it goes down quite low. Again, the brand is a bit of a concern.

QAcoustics: Mainly popular for their speakers, not so much for their subs. However, for what I've read online, people like them for what it does, but people say you can find better. 3060s would go down to 35Hz, which is not too bad, and for an office space as mine, should be decent. The QB12 would be more future proof (and perhaps spare me from another expense in the future when I crave for more), it goes down to about 25Hz too. The sealed nature is an advantage, staying relatively compact for a 12"".

Polk HTS-10/12: I liked the look of this sub. I hear it's decent too.

SVS PB-1000: Their cheapest offering I can find in India. Goes down to 19Hz, that is nuts for a 10"". Also the size of the sub, is difficult to wrap my head around. Not sure if I want that big of a block under my desk. Also, with the ported nature, I think it might suit movies better for better rumble and boomy performance. Could overwhelm my tiny space, so will probably be running with limited power to it.

I do plan on setting up a proper home theatre in the future, but I don't know when that's gonna be. Looking for some inputs is all I can say now."

audiophile,"So I've been playing around with audio for many years in many different settings. The pandemic made me end up focusing a lot more on my home setup which has been fun. I am feeling the itch to look at maybe upgrading my current setup. I will probably go in a diy direction but figured I'd reach out to everyone here and see if anyone has had similar goals and has systems that match or are closer to the endgame of my goals to point me in the right direction. 

I have a very difficult living room, it's vaulted ceiling 70's style house, fairly open floor plan, the space where I'm listening from I have a large sectional couch that is about as wide as the ""room"" as it were, lots of  floor to ceiling windows and just weird geometries in general. I have been going down the more omnidirectional/ open baffle/ dipole direction because of that, trying to make the room reflections more of a feature than a flaw. 

Currently I'm running a diy version of the Linkwitz Lx-Mini with a pair of sealed 10"" subs. I also use this (and probably more often) for watching TV and movies. It was a fun build

Here's what I like about it: 

Sounds pretty clean and detailed, I mean what else could you want? For what it is, they sound way bigger, and a lot of depth to the sound even at low volumes.

What I don't like: 

As I push them into higher volumes they become less transparent. The sweet spot is a bit smallish, because where I have to place the subs for practicality I have a big null in the 50hz region and room treatment is a difficult prospect.

Because of the shape of the couch I like to sit on the part with a chaise lounge, which is directly in front of the left speaker. Previous box speaker setups would sound like I was listening just directly to the speaker in front of me, a few times prompting me to wonder if the right speaker was even on. I'd get up and once I had crossed the center line of the speakers essentially, it would be clear that was not the case. It's not as bad with the lx-mini and I'm not sure there's too much getting around it, just dealing with what you have the best you can

Also am generally accompanied by my wife and also sometimes a few friends, I'd like the majority of the couch to be pretty similar instead of the middle being noticeably the best seat in the house. 

Ideally, this may be a fantasy, but if it were possible, I'd like a system that could do the following: 

If I were standing in the kitchen and someone was talking, singing, playing guitar or whatever, dropping marbles on the floor - in the living room, it would sound like those things are happening in the living room from the kitchen. So if I were to play a recording of those things with good imaging, and I was in the kitchen, it should sound like those things are happening in the living room. So essentially, everywhere you listen from its imaging is so good that like no matter where you are within ear shot, your mind associates where the location of the sound is in a singular point. Maybe I'm delusional and I have already peaked as far as the sound stage possibility within the limitations of the space I have to work with, idk.

Some things I've been contemplating: 

upgrading to the lx521.4 since I have the minidsp 4x10 and enough amplifiers to do pretty much anything I ever wanted 

Been also eyeing some of the GR research NX series, the Nx-otica and Nx-treme, I'm kind curious just to hear them but I'm not sure if I really have enough space for them. 

I can barely come a little more than 3ft from all the walls, I'm not sure if I really have space for stuff like magnepans or anything that really needs a ton of breathing room.

I'd like to hear about systems that are close to what I talked about, I'm fairly competent with design and research, so if something out there is similar but I can make it for cheaper diy, I'm all for it, and learning new things about sound."
audiophile,"I've wondered, if I am buying a sound system like a sound bar with remote speakers, that uses HDMI connection to the soundbar but the speakers are connected wirelessly, wouldn't that defeat the purpose of the HDMI? Perhaps the soundbar would still produce lossless audio, but can the wirelessly connected speakers?

In that vein, wouldn't that also degrade the sound of a lossless dolby atmos signal? 

Lastly, even if I had wired connections, how do I know there wires can support the bandwidth of lossless signal?"
audiophile,"Hey guys! My friend has a sick 5.1 speaker setup with 4 small, 1 middle and subwoofer speakers.

He doesn't have an amp since it's built into the subwoofer.

&amp;#x200B;

Main question: He has 3x 3.5mm outputs. 1 for the small ones, 1 for the middle one and 1 for the woofer. He wants to connect them through his laptop or the TV but both of them have only 1x 3.5mm jack. Only way we listened to some music is to run them through my desktop PC which has 6x outputs, all for individual outputs. Which adapter do we need to buy and is it possible  just to use a 3.5mm splitter thats the same for all outputs and just connect the woofer/middle speaker and small speakers to it or do they have to be specifically made for those outputs? Thanks!"
audiophile,"I'll preface by saying I know placement isn't ideal, I'm just very limited with my current living situation at the moment.

Pictured:
- Canton Karat 720 bookshelf speakers
- Altec Lansing Model 3 speakers (old setup, not connected)
- Canton Sub 10.2
- Bryston 3B-ST amp
- Schiit Jotunheim 2 (preamp)
- Cambridge Audio CXNv2

Not Pictured:
- Synology DS918+ NAS
- Technics SL-1200mk2 (not connected)

I just recently setup the Canton Speakers, and got a lucky deal on the sub from CL for $200. The Altecs are my old speakers, which I've had for like 15 years now. They are my temporary stands for the Cantons until I get proper ones, then I'll have to decide if I keep the Altecs for another purpose later or pass them on. I know Model 3's are like the bottom of the lineup of their time.

The Schiit Jotunheim is my preamp with XLR input from the CXN and XLR output to the Bryson amp. It has a phono stage instead of DAC card for when I can eventually get my turntable back out.

The CXN streams music services as well as my growing FLAC library stored on the Synology NAS.

For the near future I will be looking to get proper stands for the Canton Speakers, then in the longer term, when I move to a new place with less housemates, I can make a better arrangement for all the equipment and actually get my turntable back in play.

Appreciate any comments or feedback."
audiophile,"I've often heard a lot of people, particularly those of a young age like myself, claim that vinyl sounds better than CD. As somebody who likes buying used CDs of old releases that were mastered during the 1980s and very early 1990s (c.1982-1991), I don't agree with this. In my experience most 1980s mastered CDs sound more or less like old mint condition vinyl records except without any surface noise. By comparison, nearly all official CDs mastered from the mid 1990s to present have a lot of inherent distortion as the result of dynamic compression that is applied at the mastering stage in order to make them ""louder"". Most newer CDs and modern streaming masters/official downloads sound through decent speakers as though they're noticeably distorted while old CDs from the 1980s tend to have great dynamics and clarity, much like what a mint condition vinyl record did when it was first played.

Vinyl records degrade in quality with each play whereas a CD does not, and I find it a shame that nearly all modern dynamic sounding music releases seem to be vinyl exclusives, with their CD counterpart nearly always being a lot more dynamically compressed. I personally think that the ""vinyl is better"" argument would have been a lot less credible had CDs continued to be mastered using dynamic vinyl-style mastering like most were in the 1980s."
audiophile,"wife won't have floor speakers so I am looking for bookshelf's + sub that work nicely in 5.1.

audiophile,"I am going to ask two separate questions here. Keep in mind my application is competitive gaming and music as a side note. Right now I have a magni/modi 3+. The magni already doesn‚Äôt have a lot of headroom for my dt 990s, so I am planning on AT LEAST upgrading my amp. I would like a set up that stays true to the sound signature of the headphones as I have a collection going. Feel free to include a couple price points, maybe under 1k$ and then under 2k$. I am leaning toward the first option below but if you have experience with #2 lay it on me. I appreciate any advice at all.

1.) AMP/DAC combo.

or

2.) AMP/audio interface combo. Unsure if audio interfaces have good enough DACs. I currently have a goxlr mini but am using my stack still.

Maybe I should just get a nicer, more powerful amp and just keep everything else the same? Not sure!"
audiophile,"I have headphones that are USB wireless. They do not have a 3.5mm jack, but they do have a USB b micro slot that is used for charging the headphones. 

If I buy a conversion, meaning a cable with a USB b micro on one end of the cable and a 3.5 jack on the other end of the cable.

Could I receive / play the audio from the headphones. Even though there is no 3.5 out audio jack and only a USB b micro. 

Basically will / can sound / information be received through this port. Or is it strictly just a power port"

That being said, is there a guide/book/YouTube channel or any other resources you‚Äôd recommend on how to learn the lingo? Additionally, is listening to different setups the best way to analyze quality on its face?

audiophile,"Hey all, 

Happy Black Friday! I am new to the Audiophile group, and new to using turntables, in general. I honestly have no idea what type of set up or accessories I really need to get the most out of my vinyls, and I am seeking assistance on what are must haves. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated (bonus points if you can find a Black Friday deal and link it ;) ).

I currently only have a turntable, and am looking to enhance my experience. I have the Audio-Technica AT-LP120XB. It has Bluetooth capabilities, but I am absolutely not against using a wired speaker option, if it means better quality. I don't have any speakers (other than some bluetooth ones), and it came with a USB cable, detachable RCA output cable (dual RCA male to dual RCA male), AC adapter, 45 RPM adapter, counterweight, felt mat, and dust cover. Other than that, I do not really have anything. 

My total budget for all accessories, speakers, wires, etc. is about $750, give or take.

audiophile,"I've had a wonderful pair of cheap Behringer BH 770 headphones for awhile, and they've been serving me well, however, since it's almost the holiday with the gifts and whatnot, I thought:

""Hey! Why not get something?""

so here I am, with enough willpower to buy something but not enough to get two things I want. Here's my dilemma should I; A - Get new headphones - *Massdrop Sennheiser 6xx hd OpenBack* (since mine right now are kind of cheap and can break if I fall again - the audio jack is a little bent but should last for awhile) Or B - Buy an amp for my headphones and mic - *ARC Mk2 by mayflower electronics.* \- both are in the ballpark of $200 which I don't want to go over that badly - unless it's a great deal. 

I just want something that makes me sound good or others sound good. The main issue is that the specs on both things are great. Just not sure which I'd rather get.

P.S: This is the first time posting as well as getting an amp/openback headphones, so go easy on me. Everything is up in the air, these were just the one's I was looking at. I want an amp that works for both headphones and mic to give a boost to my and others' experience. And headphones I don't mind all that much, just as long as it's not more than my desktop computer."

I'm wondering what it would be reasonable to expect Room Correction to improve/fix, and what issues would always be apparent (or maybe even exacerbated?) even with room correction.

audiophile,"Hello guys,

First of all, please excuse my lack of knowledge about how the US voltage standard affects electronics :)

I inherited a wonderful NAD 3020i from my dad that's become an incredibly important part of my life since childhood. I'm moving to the US soon, and I find myself willing to carry the hefty amplifier all the way overseas. I have other elements to my sound system that I'll leave back home (a vintage AWA deck, etc) and I'll start building again, probably starting with a cassette player and a record player.

Is there a way I could use my NAD to do this? Is there a way I could negotiate the voltage?

I'd really appreciate your help (and patience, I'm still learning). Thanks! :)"
audiophile,"I just moved house, finished work, set the speakers up and sat down to enjoy them when the dude comes knocking with a complaint. There must be a way to mitigate this without just turning the volume all the way down past 7pm. Maybe it's the harsh reality of living in a flat?"

It doesn‚Äôt need to have a lot of power. It is for personal listening at close range or across a room. 

I am primarily concerned with fidelity, accuracy, faithfulness in bringing out and reproducing the nuances of the tracks - along with the full range. Not being too weak in certain areas. 

How much do I need to spend to get a sennheiser 280 experience in a speaker? 

Would it be over $300?

I listen mostly, but not entirely, to classical and electronic music and the way this system reproduces music is (at least to me) almost unbelievable. Especially classical music with small ensembles up to about 15 musicians sound absolutely ""photorealistic"".  If nothing breaks, this might be the first and last Hifi system I've ever bought. Though I've never heard any super expensive systems, at least to me and the friends, i auditioned it to, there can't be any improvements worth ‚Ç¨10k+ or even 100k+.

I read  that the amplifier heat is bad for cds so I thought I should put the cd sorter at the bottom, above them I should put the cd player and above all I should put the amp, is this correct?  In what order should I put them?

I have a second doubt. My neighbour lives on my left (left of the pictures) wall to wall and I don't want to bother him with my music and bass. I would like to know what I can use to insulate my bedroom, especially the left wall and the floor (I live in a penthouse). The first thing I've seen to put under the subwoofer is a [exercise mat](https://www.amazon.com/Domyos-TG100-Esterilla-ejercicio-color/dp/B007551S9A). I have a wadding, would it be useful to insulate acoustically? What cheap stuff can I use to insulate the wall and floor, and how should I put it?

Thanks!

audiophile,"Hello friends! 

I am curious how good turntables such as the technics SL1200MK7s are vs something high end. 

I ask because I am very much into hifi, but most of my gear is dedicated towards audio production as I am a musician. (Genelec studio monitors, RME ADI-2 Pro)

So I would like to get turntables to learn to mix vinyl, but I also want something that is considered high quality and gives me the level of output I need. 

So I am wondering if the SL1200‚Äôs are even considered ‚Äúgood‚Äù by the audiophile community standards. 

Or if I should look at the technics Grand Class tables, 

Or if I should just get one high end professional one for simply listening to music, and just run my dj ones into the ground as such. 

Are there major differences in the construction and quality between dj tables and hifi ones? 

Thanks for any and all input!"

audiophile,"Hello everyone. Was wondering if you could give me some suggestions for the following setups:

1- bistro/cafe 

Receiver and amp for 6 speakers with subwoofer included in each speaker.
Receiver needs to have both Bluetooth and wired INPUTS

Middle tier pricing, nothing too cheap and nothing ridiculously expensive

2- living room and backyard

Home theatre system for a rectangular room 4 x 6 metres Aprox in size. 
Receiver and amp capable of having an extra 3-4 speakers for the backyard which you can switch off when not in use. Also, the outside speakers need to be outdoor speakers with subs included in them, capable of getting wet without damaging them. 

Any ideas are welcome and I appreciate the info.

Three years later, all that stuff is sitting in the attic and he is allowed to listen to a bluetooth speaker, or headphones.

If your partner is *that* unconcerned with one of your great pleasures, your enjoyment of music / sonic art, why are you with that person? Why does *her* sense of appropriate decor win out over yours?

I'm not saying that *you* should get to decide; I'm saying that there ought to be room for compromise, mutual understanding, and respect, rather than letting your SO dictate what s/he will accept."

audiophile,"So I ended up finding a few really good sales going on and bought a pair of Klipsch RP-500M II monitors. I'm going to pair it with a Fosi BT30 amp for now while I shop around for something better. That being said, I'm a little nervous about some of the things I read regarding power. 

The monitors are 75W RMS and 300W peak with 8 ohms impedance.
The amp outputs 50W x 2 (did not realize this until after it was too late)

I know that overdriving the monitors will cause damage but I also read that clipping can cause damage as well. 

My questions here are:
1. Will the amp end up clipping if I turn the volume up all the way (supposedly outputting 50W/channel)?

2. Can clipping actually damage speakers?

3. If I bought the 100W x 2 amp instead, what considerations would I need?

I'd appreciate some help here, as I *really* don't want to damage these monitors."

Id also like to be able to collapse them and put them away but this isn‚Äôt a must tbh. Just would be a plus if the headphones collapsed. I‚Äôd also like them to be more on the compact size if that‚Äôs even an option with headphones. Not sure. 

At the end of the day, if they can‚Äôt collapse and aren‚Äôt compact sized at all, I‚Äôd still be interested in buying a high quality pair of headphones of your recommendation.

audiophile,"My first experience with Tekton Design was about 10 years ago when they first kind of blew up after getting some high profile reviews. I was in the market for some speakers and ordered a 3.1 set of M Lores (L/R/C/Sub) in cherry wood veneer finish. After reading about them I was expecting to have to wait, but after endless delays it took over a year to finally receive my speakers. I have been very happy with them, they sound great, but the initial delays and excuses still left a bad taste.

Recently I have been in the market to upgrade my system and checked out their website and saw in their FAQ them stating that as of October 2022 they were experiencing a 4-6 week lead time. I thought this meant they were keeping track of where they were and providing accurate information so I ordered a pair of Perfect SET 15s with upgrades, about $2500 total. After about 4.5 weeks I had not heard anything from them so I emailed asking for an expected ship date and was told my order was still weeks out and that the *minimum* lead time was 6-8 weeks. After going through what I did with them before I asked for a refund, and to not pay the cancellation feel since they had not yet started building the speakers. I got an email back the next day saying the speakers would ship the following Monday. I didn't really trust this and replied that I just wanted to cancel. I then ordered a pair of Klipsch Forte IVs which arrived 2 days later.

After the email exchange I got a text from Eric, the owner of Tekton, asking me to call him. I replied by text that I just wanted to cancel. We got through the weekend with no response from them. I emailed on Monday asking them to confirm the cancellation and got no response. I emailed again Tuesday, offering to pay the cancellation fee if they just cancelled the order, and finally Wednesday I got an email from them letting me know they cancelled and took the fee. So now I am out nearly $500 for a set of speakers I never received and they never planed on shipping within the timeframe indicated on their website until I complained, but again my prior experience with them led me to believe they would not have met that deadline anyway. 

The M Lores have been great speakers, but I just don't want to purchase from a company that operates like this. Looking at a company like Decware, they are a similar small company with a long lead time but they go as far as to publish their build sheet on their website so you know exactly where you are in line and how long to expect to wait when making the purchase. Plus, they do not make you pay the full price up front like Tekton does. I'm enjoying my Forte IV's and will for many years to come. 

Tekton's FAQ section still says as of October 2022 they are shipping within 4-6 weeks, don't trust it"

audiophile,"I have been reading a lot about PA speakers and was convinced that with the SRM450's V1's I would get the sound I was looking for (for a reasonable price), because they have (as confirmed by the manual) an AB-class amp for the highs and a G-class amp for the lows. So I was expecting a powerful low.. but somehow it is not performing like I was expecting. I also tried the Mackie Thump 12A's which I also did not like so much.. It leaves me quite surprised because so many like the 450's. The Thumps are not so popular and I understand why. These D-class amps just don't deliver when you are used to AB-class.

Hi,

  Sorry if isn't a good place to ask about gaming headset but idk where i can ask r/HyperX is kinda dead..   
I have a slightly static noise inherent in my cloud core II wireless, isn't affected by the volume, loud or quiet, i thought that maybe it was because I received a defective unit. i bought 1 cloud core wireless(returned) and i have the same issue with this one,¬† i am thinking of returning these as well. isn't the buzzing loud static noise.¬†  
I saw other explanation like:

&gt;It's definitely there, especially noticeable in a very quiet environment.¬†¬†  
It's a sort of whine, and it's the result of hearing the carrier frequency the wireless is using. Those whose hearing is good enough to hear that high up in the frequency range will definitely notice it.¬†  
That whine is the carrier, and once signal cuts off, the circuit will shut off to conserve power, and that's why the whine disappears along with the soft ""pop"" of the circuit switching off.

is this normal for wireless head set/phone?"

So I have a small 12x12 bedroom, and I want to fill it with sound digitally. I don‚Äôt have room correction or acoustic treatment handy (more on this later). 

Setup:

1. My idea is to buy some powered monitors, let‚Äôs just say for the sake of this the LSR 305s. 

2. Then I have a DAC I want to use that only has RCA inputs, let‚Äôs say the Modi Multibit.

4. I want some form of room correction, so let‚Äôs say we add a minidsp 2x4.

So my questions are, how do I set all this up? What cables will I need? Is it possible? And in what order?

How do I use the minidsp with the pi-based steamer? Is this even possible? Are there any guides on using minidsp when you‚Äôre a complete idiot/newbie to the concept of dsp?

Are there any other suggestions for good powered monitors? Are the airmotiv 5S better regarded? 

Will the powered monitors even need dsp to sound good in such a small room?

audiophile,"Main amp (rx-v661) second amp (rx-v363) first photo is the main amp and the second photo is the secondary amp. its connected by RCA  as you can hopefully see. the input is optical and I can't get the signal to the back amp through the RCA unless I use RCA as my input. is there a way to do it so I can use optical as my input and the second amps volume be controlled by the main one?
do I need to use an optical cable to the second amps because of the input being optical? (the optical out port next to the optical input) would optical work in that situation?

i know it's unnecessary to have the second amp I just have the ability to add speakers when I find them, and it runs my second subwoofer since the first amp only has one pre out. so I would like it running properly. any help is greatly appreciated."

audiophile,"Hi all,

I'd like to get a new WIFI speaker as my current soniq -ANB104 just doesn't seem to cut it quality wise.

I know Sonos and harmon are renowned for quality but pretty much every review I'm seeing is saying that Google nest audio is easily comparable in quality to both speakers speakers.

At the moment I can get a single Sonos One speaker for $259 but this means it won't provide stereo sounds until I can afford another one down the line.

To buy 2 Google Nest Audio's or 2 Harman Kardon Citation One mkII speakers will cost me $300 and provide stereo sound.

I'm most interested in quality of the sound the speakers output and less influenced by smart assistant features my phone can typically handle anyway.

What would you recommend?"
audiophile,"I‚Äôve been trying to find me a good speaker for my room, nothing too crazy expensive with any cables, but something crazy when it comes to audio definition.

audiophile,"Hello,

I have a matantz amp and wired speakers. It sounds pretty good but space is an issue for me so I‚Äôm looking at options for different set up without replacing everything. I‚Äôm wondering is there any way I can convert my wired speakers into Bluetooth ones by somehow having a connection from the speakers and a separate connection from the amp that talk to each other, to eliminate the wires. My marantz amp does not have Bluetooth and my speakers aren‚Äôt Bluetooth. This would allow me flexibility on the positioning of the speakers. Would this affect the sound quality much to the ears of a normal person? 

Many thanks üôè"

One slight problem, it's pretty pricey comming in around $550 MSRP. I was wondering, is that price standard for these outdoor speakers, or is there an alternative to this model thats less expensive.

audiophile,"Hello, sorry if this post breaks the rules, but I was wondering what a good first turntable would be for vinyls. That's pretty much it."
audiophile,"After about a year of listening to Tidal, I noticed Chick Corea's ""Hot House,"" album sounded weird - but only in Tidal's regular ""Hi-Fi"" (or CD quality) version of the album. (Their ""Master"" version of the album actually sounds fine, and I think that's what I was listening to before trying the non-Master version.) I listened on the Tidal Android app with a USB DAC, through USB Audio Player Pro on Android, the Windows app through a Presonus interface, and even casting to Chromecast, all with the exact same results - something was noticeably different about this Tidal version of the album.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an example track from the album, the title track ""Hot House."" Listen to the piano in the first few seconds - if you listen closely, it sounds almost garbled up, choppy, warbly, and like it's bouncing around between left and right - wish I knew a better way to describe it!

Tidal's messed-up ""HiFi version"" - [https://tidal.com/browse/track/14062380](https://tidal.com/browse/track/14062380)

The same track in Tidal's ""Master"" quality - [https://tidal.com/browse/track/91579926](https://tidal.com/browse/track/91579926)

The same track on Qobuz - [https://open.qobuz.com/track/5130103](https://open.qobuz.com/track/5130103)

The same track on Spotify - [https://open.spotify.com/track/2mWeR7Vs62MQgCNcZKYfgS?si=6a3cf7f47da5442f](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mWeR7Vs62MQgCNcZKYfgS?si=6a3cf7f47da5442f)

&amp;#x200B;

I figured it was just a fluke, but then a couple months later I came across Bobo Stenson Trio's ""Serenity,"" and it had the same problem - though it takes a little more careful listening to notice it. Focusing on the piano is probably the easiest way to notice the problem.

Here are different versions of the track ""Golden Rain:""

Tidal doesn't have a better version of this album, though, so we're stuck with the inferior sounding one. This is why I started a Qobuz free trial...

&amp;#x200B;

And again, I've tested this on different setups, and haven't had a problem with any other albums (yet!) so I don't see this as a troubleshooting/tech support issue.

Can anyone else hear this, and if so is there a term for this specific sound issue? What error could be causing it? And has anyone heard this issue on any other albums on Tidal, or anywhere else? Thanks for reading!"

**Bel Canto C5i - Integrated Amplifier**  
**Rega RP1** (will be upgrading to a RP3 or RP6).

I picked up some **Kef** **q150's** on sale to build a desktop set up in my office. Will be purchasing some additional components as well as utilizing some ones I already own from the list above.

Questions.

**- Integrated Amp Suggestion: CXA81 vs C5i.** Looking for an additional integrated amplifier. I've been eyeing the Cambridge CXA81. Something with the power to build upon over time. I like the USB connectivity to connect and drive via Mac OSX. Would you use the c5i with the Q150 desktop setup? or keep it with the living room set up and use the CXA81?

Understanding that the CXA81 doesn't have a Phono pre amp and if I choose to have a turntable in my office as well... I will need to additionally purchase pre amp separately. Not a huge concern at the moment.

**- Kef Subwoofer Q400b:** I am thinking of using this with my desktop set up and getting a new sub for the Q500 towers in my living room. Any suggestions on updating the sub to match the Q500? Or should I keep the q400b with the q500 and opt for the SVS Micro 3000 to go with the desktop set up?"

Do rich people just not know how to enjoy their money? I feel like with a $20,000,000 price tag I should be getting all the good stuff that home living entails; a pool, a movie theater, temperature-controlled wine cellar and cannabis storage, wide open area for VR, multiple outdoor spaces, views out the ass, and for fuck's sake a single room for listening to music.

question for y'all non vinyl individuals for new music do you buy cds and rip them, download or just stream?"
audiophile,"Hello!

As I am thinking about getting Diffusors for my listening room, I was facing the high prices and thought about making them on my own.

Of course there are the tutorials with wood, which I find pretty amazing, but very time consuming.

That's why I was thinking of maybe building some sort of solid consistency pattern that I can then pour plaster, let it cure, and end up with a white diffuser panel that I can color to my liking, etc.

Something like this should be possible with plaster or similar materials, right? 

Would not like to use plastics such as Styrofoam or similar materials, so should not release any gases into the room air, because of various allergies and sensitivity reactions that are unfortunately present in my case.

Do you think this would be feasible, or maybe even have experience with it?

However, whenever I turn the volume of the Fiio higher or the amp, the power guard will turn on and the speakers would crackle. Afraid I'm damaging the speakers or amplifier so looking for guidance!

audiophile,"Hey, I have had tinnitus for as long as I can remember. I love going to live shows, and about a year ago started wearing ear plugs to every show I go to. I found a decent pair but they don't stay in for more than a couple hours, which is a problem during festivals. I just went to the audiologist and got molds made so I can get custom ear plugs. When she asked me about exactly what type of plugs I wanted to have made, I wasn't sure exactly what to pick...

They had the options for ""solid ear plugs"" and ""musician's ear plugs."" The latter had filters for like 10 db, 17 db, 26 db, and impulse. The solid ear plugs were just solid, which she told me was as if it was about 27 db, and she assured me that it should have a flat attenuation across all frequencies. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure how true that would be in actuality and if I'm paying a couple hundred dollars for ear plugs, I want to make sure they aren't compromising on sound quality at my concerts. Does anyone more knowledgeable than me have any recommendations? Is there an appreciable difference between the solid plugs and frequency attenuated plugs (tbh 10 and 17 db attenuation don't sound like very adequate protection if I'm at a festival in the front row).

Should I be calling them to change my order to musician ear plugs?"

audiophile,"hi audiophiles.  ive got the ls50 metas sitting in the box for a while now since i am still looking to purchase an amp and what better time than now. I have been recommended many amps and the one that strikes out at me is the Lyngdorf TDAI-1120. The only problem is that it doesn't have pc usb input and would require me to upgrade to the TDAI-3400 which is just out of my budget. The reason for this amp is of course its DSP and RoomPerfect. I've also looked at the NAD M10, Cambridge Audio EVO 150, Naim Atom, but these amps all have similar outputs (except the EVO 150 having a PC USB ouput) . I plan to only use this amp at my desk and never plan to use any streaming capabilities. I want to be able to play audio when watching youtube, netflix, etc. What's the difference between using the PC USB output vs having an amp hooked up via optical to a dac that is connected to the computer? let me know!"

audiophile,"My house is wired for 5.1 which for a couple of years I used with an inexpensive AVR and some decent speakers. I've recently upgraded my speakers and purchased a nice stereo integrated, thinking I'd not miss 5.1 but i do.

I'd like to have a setup with the eBay if both and the easy answer is to get an AVR with pre outs and just use the integrated to run the L/R channels buy the problem then becomes bass management. I still like to run a sub in stereo for music, right now I'm running wires from the speaker terminals to the high level input on the sub and it works well. With the AVR in the mix, through, that is not an option. My brain keeps going in circles with this. What would a recommended setup be to manage this without having to be constantly disconnecting/reconnecting cables?"
audiophile,"I've been having a minor but highly annoying problem with an NAD C658 preamp/streamer that I purchased from Crutchfield over a year ago. The unit is still under warranty, and the NAD website said to initiate a warranty claim thru the original retailer. 

I call Crutchfield to do just that, and 5 minutes later they are shipping me a brand new unit, and sent me a return label to send the old unit back. 

I thought I'd have to send it to a repair shop, wait 6 months to get it back, cobble together an interim solution so I could continue to listen to music in my office and I'm just thrilled that I don't have to do any of that. 

Anyway, just wanted to pass along a great experience with one of the bigger online electronics retailers. It's 2022, almost 2023 and customer service like that is just such a rarity. And also such a treat when you experience it."

Also just seems the Magnius reaches higher volumes without having to go as high as the A90D's volume control.

Can I test them without a dac and amp? This is ideal but if not I'll find a solution. The guy lives a little far but has agreed to come by as he's coming to my area in a few days.

I primarily use for gaming and I've heard they're even better than the 800s from a few people.

I've had fairly good headphones over the years - the more expensive Bose for music. Some decent Shure in ear. Arctis Nova Pro for gaming... but this will be my first pair of proper audiophile headphones &amp; given my current financial situation, is already a stretch - but hey - it's Xmas soon :)

audiophile,"I don't know if this fits here because it's not audio technically. My 14y.o. Daughter wants a turntable and speakers along with a handful of albums for Christmas.
I haven't looked but she threw a double things my way. Basically ones with Bluetooth and ones with out. I know it's horrible but I I'm thinking of going the Bluetooth root with a decent set of active speaker.  the turntable would I assume need a pre out for wired and of course a Bluetooth transmitter for Bluetooth. My things is headphones and high end car audio and I deal mostly in bits and bytes so turntable and vinal are sort of foreign to me aside from my table when I was young which was a long time ago. If there is any kind sole out there who might be able to help that would be great. Perhaps this will be deleted. I'm only looking too spend $500-$700."

audiophile,"Hello, 

I currently run an Rotel RB-1070 which I bought NOS about a year ago. I am currently running an NAD M12 as a preamp. My speakers are POLK R700's, the sound is really good and the components have good synergy. I estimate the the Rotel is putting out anywhere between 130-200 watts. I never max out my power of course. 

I am thinking the next upgrade I should be looking into is my amplifier. I am strongly thinking about picking up a 1ET400a Purifi stereo from Buckeye. At $1200, I should get much lower distortion (not that I can hear any at any volume level from the RB-1070) and I am thinking I will get a more refined sound due to newer technology. If the Buckeye makes an appreciable difference I am thinking the next step would be to find a good used NAD M23 and sell the buckeye. They both use the Purifi modules but NAD has a much better power core, input buffer, and output stage. 

My question after all this is I have never heard a different amplifier in my system and very much have a fear that that I will not hear a good increase in sound quality (honestly, I am really looking for a bigger more holographic stage) from my RB-1070 which is more than enough power for my R700's to the Buckeye. I know the measurements of the buckeye trump the RB-1070 by a long shot, but that does not always translate into better sound imho. Does anyone have experience with this kind of change and is the difference likely to be palpable or negligible?

I have a feeling that the toroidal transformer and 40,000 cu capacitance in the RB-1070 will still trump the Buckeye amp with the NCORE power supply and whatever capacitance those 4 caps have. I know class D is much more efficient but will that translate into better sound with the Purifi modules or am I really just wasting my time?"

audiophile,"Hi, everyone. I've been collecting CDs for 20+ years. My personal collection is around 5,000 discs right now.

Back in 2017 and earlier, I used to rip my CDs to iTunes and listen to music while running. I stopped in 2018 when I moved from Texas to Colorado and put all my CDs into storage boxes. SInce then, I have relied more on streaming services than physical CDs.

Going forward, I would like to start ripping CDs again ‚Äîmainly to listen to my CD collection while I'm running ‚Äî but I'm unsure where to start since I've heard that Apple no longer supports iTunes or sells iPod devices.

Should I buy an [Apple USB SuperDrive](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD564LL/A/apple-usb-superdrive) to rip CDs, or is there a better Mac OS X-compatible option on the market these days?

What kind of external hard drive should I buy for storage? How much storage do I need for 5,000 CDs (or maybe up to 7,500 to ensure I'm future-proofed for a long time)?

Should I consider using [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/) to manage my files, or is there a better option?

What kind of lossless audio file format should I use? I'll mainly be listening to music with headphones while running.

What am I overlooking?

This is a huge project that could take several years to finish, so I want to ensure I'm doing everything correctly and efficiently from day one.

audiophile,"My microphone name randomly disappeared, and was replaced by an audio named advanced audio which didn‚Äôt work like how it used to be. My mic: FIFINE K678."
audiophile,"In my search for the ultimate sound-experience a not-infinite budget could reach, I've came across these speakers. On our digital local marketplace an hifi enthousiast created an add for another set of speakers (Troels Gravesen diy speaker with highend components) which caught my attention. I went out to audition them.

I was not blown away by the sound and thought the 110+ centimeter in height of that speaker would never have the essential spouse approval. He told me he was about to list another set of slightly smaller speakers. He connected them: and WOW. I was sold right there.

A grotesque, vast soundstage, crystal clear in the highs. And it was pounding deep. Deeper than what I thought would be possible with 6.5' drivers. Accuton mids en highs, (modest) Audax Prestige woofers. Beautifully fitted in the wood work.

The speakers were a design by a Belgian audiofile Benny Glass, probably somewhere in 90s. Filters, elcos and internal wiring got upgraded not too long ago by a reputable local company.

The result is nothing short of amazing. The sound is full, rich and clear. There is no harshness of the ceramic Accuton/Thiel drivers, it is just very transparant. And it digs quite low: it is making my modest SVS 1000 pro absolete: the added value of this sub pretty much inaudible. It is fairy sensitive set: my CXA81 is able to drive this speaker very well.  

Right now I am over the moon and I think I finally found my long term speakers. The re-sell value is maybe more limited compared to bigger brands, but i am 100% positive these speakers sound way above what spending the same money on well-known brands would get me.

Any itches about uograding will be on the amp-side. But for now I'm good. Said no audio-enthousiac ever."
audiophile,"Dear all,  


this might be a naive question but... I've got a Pioneer A-60 amplifier from the 1980s, and on its backside I can see a selector like the one in the linked picture (top-right corner).

I need to connect two speakers to the amplifier, so I should look at the A,B portion of the selector diagram.

Now, the two speakers are 6 ohms (DALI Spektor 2 100W). Can I connect them to the amplifier without any worries? If so, how should I set the switch? 4-6 or 6-16?

The amplifier specifications say: 100 watt  for each channel, at 8 ohm... so why does the selector allow me to go down to 4 or 6 ohms?

I'm rather confused here.

Thank you!

audiophile,"Hi,

I have a NAD 310 amplifier that is about 20 years old. It is paired with a NAD C521i cd player and 2 Kef Crestas.  For a while the system has had a low level buzz and one speaker was popping.  Finally today I got round to testing the individual components.

https://imgur.com/gallery/2sB6QEP

First I checked if the CD player was the issue and connected a phone via the 35mm jack on the front of the amp. It still buzzed and popped.

Next I took the amp to another hifi system in the house; an old Denon receiver and tape deck with JBL shelf speakers. Same buzzing. So, confirmed the amp has a buzzing problem.

Next I took the popping Kef Cresta also to that Denon system and connected it. Loud music hip hop with heavy bass presented no popping. Very strange, but it seems the amp was also causing the popping.

Is it worth getting the amp fixed somehow or is not not worth it? NAD are not so expensive that I would repair at any costs. 

If I need to replace, what would be a good value amplifier to replace it with?

I have my eye on a returned NAD C316V2.

Are there receivers that can do this mic/RCA simultaneous audio? If there isn't one for under ~$100 new, I was going to buy used.

I'll stick to the streaming for now, but trying to figure out what kind of system to get has me totally stumped. Everything has changed so much. I want to hook one up for inside and run some wire for outside. I'm in the country and want it loud. 
Can anyone point me where to even begin figuring this out? Do I need room adapting tech? What to look for? Thanks for any help!"

audiophile,I‚Äôm hearing from friends that the difference between running a turntable with a built in pre-amp through an AV receiver or a dedicated 2 channel integrated amp is minimal.  I'm a noob with very little understanding of what I would or wouldn't gain by springing for a decent integrated amp. Is this true?
audiophile,Can someone tell me the difference between these two. I don't have the luxury of auditioning in my place. I need to buy a good wireless system for music. I expect neutral sound. If I am going for B&amp;W I will pair it with Marantz PM7000N for wireless streaming. And either way i will add Elac sub3010 for bass.
audiophile,"Hi, I'm looking to figure out how much I should spend on a headphone splitter. I don't want to skimp and hurt my sound too much, by my setup is pretty intro-level and I don't want to overpay for something that I won't notice the quality of either.

I have Hifiman Sundara headphones and a Magni/Modi Schitt stack. I have vinyl, but I really just mostly run Deezer downloads. Any recommendations, budget or modelwise?

 I don't think this matters but it will just be running two pairs of Sundaras simultaniously."

audiophile,"Hi all, and thanks in advance. With the Black Friday deals already hitting, I thought this would be a good opportunity to get a stereo set for my TV, in a \~12 m¬≤ living room (for which i'm currently using a small portable speaker that I had lying around).

Essentially, I'm looking at a price range around 2k EUR, or a couple hundred around that. My go-to shop for these things has been the HiFi Klubben - and I'm currently satisfied with the pair of active Argon Audio Forte A4 that I use on my PC.

That said, wife and I had been keeping an eye on the Forte A55 Mk2 for the TV, but it seems like a new model that will not have discounts anytime soon (the HDMI/ARC felt like a good feature compared to the older model).

Then, the Dali Callisto 6 currently has a kickass discount. The thing is, if we are gonna spend that type of money, wife would prefer the B&amp;W 603 S2 Anniversary, which we had the chance to listen to before and is around the same price with a smaller discount. Generally speaking, both of us preferred the type of ""sound profile"" from B&amp;W vs. the Dalis, but then we would have to factor in an amp. So here are the questions:

\-In this case, is the Dali Callisto 6 a ""no-brainer""? As in, is it an entire tier above, or is it that the extra cost (not looking at the discount) is only for the connectivity and fancy features? We do not have the possibility to listen to this particular model, so we are assuming it just follows the ""Dali profile"" (or does it?).

\-How much would I need to spend, minimum, to get an amp that will work well with the B&amp;W 603 S2 but is as basic as possible? By basic  I mean few channels (honestly I just need the stereo and maybe a sub-woofer in the future), will not overheat when stuck in a drawer, and hopefully has HDMI/ARC. Also, can I have some model recommendation?

\-Considering the room size and that we are not really going to listen to it in high volumes, does it make sense to just forget about these and really go for the cheaper Argon Forte A55?"

audiophile,"Total newb on audio tech here, so apologies in advance. 

I have started using a FocusRite Saffire PRO 14 to try to play high-res lossless audio off of my Mac into an old-school hi fi amp (specs below).
 
I'm using the Saffire's headphone monitor out through an RCA adapter into the amp. I know this is stereo, and I have an individual volume control for this output. 

However, the back of the Saffire has outputs as well. These give you the option of adding 48 v of phantom power, and they have their own gain knobs. 

For these outputs, the Saffire manual says:
""Either 1/4 inch TRS (balanced) or TS (unbalanced) jack connectors can be used.""

Therefore stereo seems to be viable for this output. 

My question is whether it would be a bad idea to try to use that 48 v phantom power. I'm thinking it might provide a preamp effect, but I don't want to blow my amp--an old Technics SU 70. 

Here are the specs of that amp. Any thoughts?

Power output: 110 watts per channel into 8‚Ñ¶ (stereo)

Frequency response: 10Hz to 80kHz

Total harmonic distortion: 0.03%

Input sensitivity: 2.5mV (MM), 150mV (line)

Signal to noise ratio: 73dB (MM), 94dB (line)

Output: 150mV (line)

Speaker load impedance: 8‚Ñ¶ to 16‚Ñ¶"

audiophile,"My girlfriend listens to an insane amount of music, she has excellent taste as well - it's a big part of her life. But she just lugs her Ultimate Ears Megaboom (which is ok for what it is) from room to room in her house. She really appreciates my set up at my place though (Quad s2's, BK Sub, ifi zen stream, Rotel A14MKII), so it's got me thinking about setting something up that's an improvement for her.

Spotify connect is a must, so was thinking Wiim Mini. Discreetness of the set up is also important so was considering a small chi-fi class d amp - Aiyima A07 are really well reviewed and have enough power. A friend has Dali Spektors 1'a in his kitchen and I was really impressed with the sound/value/size/aesthetics of those (you can get them in white!) so that is the speaker choice.

My question is, is the dac in the Wiim good enough - or am I overthinking this? Just read numerous opinions that it is really terrible. My suspicion is that she would still feel a big upgrade over her bluetooth speaker. I don't want a separate dac box. But would consider opinions on other cheaper amps that have dacs built in.

I don't have a big budget - so wouldn't go beyond ¬£150 on the amp.

Thoughts appreciated on the Wiim dac and chi-fi bargains!"

audiophile,"Hi people, I'm wondering about what neutral truly is. So, my line of thought goes like this: given a source of sound that has multiple frequencies and the same sound intensity (db) in each frequency, our ears would perceive the 2-9k region as quieter, because of the pinna gain. 
So if a hypothetical headphone delivered unchanged sound signal (total flat, no pinna gain), music producers would have to rise the volume of instruments in the 2-9k region in order to make them sound at the same volume of other frequencies. But since all audio gear has (generally) some kind of pinna gain, they don't have to worry about it, and can keep the sound intensity (db) of the instruments in this range the same as other ranges. 
The mistery arises when we look at the bass part of the harman target. Our ears don't affect how we perceive the bass region, we don't atenuate it like we do with the 2-9k region. So why harman boosted it? Maybe people liked to hear old songs with an extra boost of bass. Now, because of harman, what happens is that music producers of this century tune their music to sound good in the harman curve (since most mainstream headphones more or less follow it). As a result, flat response gear (that just have the pinna gain, and not the bass boost) ends up sounding bass anemic with newmainstream recordings, something that ideally shound't happen, but may still sound good with old recordings, or with records from people that don't mix based on harman curve. Is this correct?"

I did this 2 more times before I eventually switch the wires on the back of the speaker and the test works then.

audiophile,"Hey all,

Wanted to pick the r/audiophile hive mind re: how well (or not) a single centre channel speaker could work for a mono near-field setup at my work desk.

I recently inherited a very basic, low-power Realistic receiver (STA-110, 22 wpc) from a deceased relative and I'm interested in setting up a simple office system for casual listening and background music. The receiver itself is nothing special in terms of power / fidelity, but it has sentimental value, it's in mint condition and it looks sharp so I'd like to get it up and running. I've already got a proper 2 channel rig in the living room for critical listening, so I'm really just interesting in getting something generally pleasant sounding put together here.

The way my office is configured really doesn't lend itself to good positioning of bookshelf speakers, unfortunately.  If I go that route, they'll end up positioned in pretty weird spots in the room (behind me, up in a corner, definitely not equidistant, etc). I had the thought that maybe a single centre channel that is wall mounted directly above my monitor could make for a simple and tidy setup that'd do the trick. Obviously I'd have to run it in mono, but that's fine by me in this room.

My main concerns:

1) Can a centre channel speakers work for a near-field configuration like this? The front baffle of the speaker would end up probably 12"" - 16"" from my forehead, so it'd quite literally be an ""in your face"" style setup. Would this create any issues in terms of phase/driver alignment and such? Depends on the speaker maybe? Any stats I should be looking out for that'd help me suss out good or bad options in this regard?

2) If the above is not an issue, how do centre channels typically sound in terms of their frequency response? I'm not expecting booming bass, but are decent mids and highs to be expected so long as the speaker is relatively efficient and can work with the meager 22wpc I'll be feeding the speaker? Or am I looking at an ""all mids all the time"" sound given that centre channels are usually used to handle vocals in HT setups?

Appreciate any input anyone can give üôè"

I‚Äôm looking to get my first Hi-Fi set up now that I‚Äôm not living with 4 other people. 

I currently have an At - LP120XBT. What do you recommend as far as receivers and speakers go? Looking to spend around 1K give or take an extra hundred or two.  

Since Black Friday is coming up I was hoping to utilize those discounts. I saw Klipsch has a sale right now but I‚Äôve read a lot of posts shit talking that company? 

Thanks for the help! üôèüèΩ"
audiophile,"My setup right now is an ATLP60x with KRK Rokit monitors, sounds kinda cold though. Could a phono help?"
audiophile,"I already have some polk audio speakers that I like. They aren't the best, but the quality and tone sounds good to my ears.

I also want to add some speakers in my office and garage and bedroom.

I can go Sonos but that would be rebuying 7+ speakers. I know of the hubs but they are no cheaper :(

I also have 3-4 rpis (rpi 3, rpi 4) lying around doing nothing. I could buy some HiFiBerry for those.

I was looking for some software that would allow me to play music to all of them at once. Ideally they would synchronize or I could specify a delay for each.

Does anything like that exist? Ideally would support Qobuz and Spotify
My end goal would be to utilize sensors in each of the areas of my house, and as I move around, the music would follow me."
audiophile,"There was, back in the late 90s and early 2000s a record review website run by a guy who had an enormous record collection and who wrote very detailed reviews. It was a phenomenal resource for finding new music. Eventually the dude shuttered it due to the amount of hatemail he got. 

I can‚Äôt remember what it was called and would love to try and dredge it up in the wayback machine. 

I know those are bare scraps of info but does anyone have any recollection of it and what it might have been called?

If you are out there dude you should resurrect it and monetise it."
audiophile,"My friend and I got annoyed with trying to find new music on Spotify, especially new/undiscovered artists.

audiophile,"Hi guys, I hope this is the right place to post this. I‚Äôm very inexperienced when it comes to technology so please bare with me. I bought the Pyle PMXU63BT mixer last week, and plan to use it for a 4 person podcast. I have 4 Behringer mics and have the XLR cords for them. The only part I‚Äôm a bit confused on is what I can record from. I know I can hook it up to a computer,  but is there a way I can record the audio to my phone or a tablet or something? That would be much easier for my situation. If so, please let me know if I‚Äôd need a special cord or  anything like that. I hope this has enough info for you guys."
audiophile,"I am no audiophile myself (so bear with me) but I have a set of earbuds I bought randomly at airport years ago. Since my previous headphones broke I've used it to listen to music, make calls and mainly play games on my pc.

It doesn't have the greatest sound for music! But during gaming I can clearly hear every little movement, every step or effect and clearly identify where it is coming from, to a point it felt magical.

(Now comes the twist) When I bought **proper headphones,** thinking it will get even better, but I hear way less, the volume is way lower and I can no longer point out exact directions. It sucks. With those earbuds when I plugged them in my pc I had to lower volume to 50% to have it at level that doesn't blow my head away. With my new headphones I have to go 100% and even up it in EQ to achieve similar level of volume. And the clarity is way worse. 

I bought Logitech G733 first and I also bought Logitech Pro X thinking it must be because I went cheaper route, both have great reviews and claim to be great at positional sounds but I can't even clearly tell with some sounds whether they come from front or from back.

So my question is, am I doing something wrong? Is it wrong settings? Is it me falling into marketing trap? Or is it that they are wireless?

At this point I am afraid to buy another 150$ headphones just to test this out and don't know what to do.

The game we're talking about is Hunt: Showdown, it has a brilliant sound design to a point where you can close eyes and shoot enemies blind on 30-40m and some players do.

I've made sure my surround sound is off (game takes care of that) and I've also played around with EQ with no great benefit and I am kind of getting desperate.

So, is it settings? Headphones? Or am I destined to game with 10$ earbuds that bring me better sound clarity than anything else?

Just wanna make sure there isn't any common reason for this before I go and buy another headset."

audiophile,"Hello, in my obvious stupidity and user error while streaming from outside the house, I ran my Focal Sopra 2s at like 95 percent loud volume from Naim Uniti Nova, for about 60 seconds, and I'm guessing I've caused some damage. 

Any ideas on how I can test the Sopra's to assess? TBH I'm playing tracks now through them and I can't hear any noticeable difference (PHEW...) , and there is no visible physical damage when taking off covers. 

Sopra 2s... Can I damage them by running at too loud volume for less than a minute??

audiophile,"Hi! Greetings from Mexico.

I want to upgrade my current floor-standing speakers (Pioneer SP-FS52) to either the Klipsch RP-8000F (mk i), JBL Studio 580 (at 1.15x the cost of the 8000s) or the KEF Q950 (at 1.6x the cost of the 8000s). Never mind the amounts in USD since audio gear costs more here than in the US.

What would you say are the pros/cons of ones vs the others?
What main differences can one expect (all other things being equal: amp, room, etc)?
Do the KEFs justify the additional 60% in cost? Why?
Which could maintain their second hand value better?

audiophile,"Subwoofer for Kef LSX II

Hello everyone, I recently purchased the KEF LSX2 for listening to music in the living room, no home theatre set up. I was comparing these to the Sonos five and while Sonos had better low end. I preferred the vocals and soundstage on the Kefs. Not to mention the Kef lsx2s look a lot better and have a smaller footprint. I am in a townhome, so not a big house. I was looking to get a decent subwoofer for around $500 to get that Sonos punch without it sounding boomy. Any recommendations? I am not an audiophile, nor having the expertise of crossover frequency tuning. Looking for something simple that can add more depth without breaking the bank. But willing to pay more for quality and ease of use. Any recommendations? Thank you"
audiophile,"I'm thinking of getting a soundbar as my apartment but I don't care about movie audio much at all, I'm more focused on ambient music sound if I'm having a party or just listening to music. 

Are there any recommendations on soundbars that focus less on the theatre sound quality and more on overall ambient music quality? I see the Sennheiser Ambeo Plus, not sure if people have experience  / opinions on that one. The other one I'm thinking about is a Samsung Q800B. Cheaper and I have a Samsung TV that it can connect to.

I know soundbars are generally worse quality than AV setups but I live in a NYC apartment that's smallish so I think a setup like that will be overkill, again particularly since I don't watch movies a lot or need a thundering base, I just want really euphonic quality if I want to play tunes over my speakers"
audiophile,"Hi everyone!

Forgive my lack of knowledge, but I don't have much idea about sound equipment. I have an old cd receiver. It is a Denon Cd Receiver RCD-M33. I would like to use it as a music listening center and I have several doubts.

1. I can use it as an amplifier for a turntable? (I have a technics SL-1210mk2). Of course, adding a pre-amp.
2. This equipment has small speakers. Can I connect larger speakers such as KEF150, Elac B6, Diamond 12.1 etc.? Back puts ""Speakers impedance 6-16 Œ©""
3. If I can use it, will I notice an improvement if I use an amplifier like Sony STR-*DH190 or Yamaha As-201?*

Thanks in advance!"
audiophile,"Is it possible to get the Sound from my tv to play on my Harman Kardon citation mk3, doesn't matter how. I am also using a denon ceol. If anybody knows if it is possible please let me know."
audiophile,"So here's the deal. . .   I have a nice DAC.  It's not the highest spec, but nice enough for me.  I have multiple digital sources: CD player, Blu-Ray,  PS4, AppleTV, Roku Soundbridge.  And I would like for all of them to route through this DAC.  Keep everything consistent.

My video sources (Blu-Ray, PS4, AppleTV) go by HDMI to the TV set, which itself has a TOSLINK output.  The (vintage) CD player has a TOSLINK output.  The old Soundbridge (Roku's first product!) has a TOSLINK output.  And I do like TOSLINK.  I've been using it for many years, from way back, and it continues to be what it has always been: simple and reliable.

But, the DAC has one TOSLINK input, not three.  I needed a switch.  An optical switch.

They exist.  I've found two different categories: passive and active.  The passive switch contains no electronics.  It has a big, spring-loaded knob that physically moves three optical connectors and brings each one, in turn, into contact with the single output.  In theory, this is the purest and most efficient possible way to go.  The problem for me is, it's an awkward, ugly, toy-like, plastic gadget.  Because there are no electronics, there's no possibility of remote control.  And the knob action. . .  It reminds me of those old, old TV sets.  CLUNK-CLUNK-CLUNK.  Except it's not even a heavy, solid CLUNK like those old tuners.  It's a sproingy, hollow, plastic CLUNK.

Then there are the active switches with electronics.  These can have three or four inputs (I don't think I've ever seen more than four) and usually one or two outputs (I did see an example with four outputs), and a remote.  So, a remote control is a good thing.  The body is made of metal, even though most of them are poorly finished with black crinkle paint.  The design and construction is kind of janky, made as cheaply as possible in China, and it doesn't inspire confidence or look great on my shelf.  I'm uncertain how it works internally.  Obviously it contains some IC chips.  Does it capture the input signal digitally and then regenerate that signal to the output port?  Wouldn't that introduce possible problems with jitter, etc?  Or does it use an analog circuit to couple the input and output, and naively replicate whatever signal comes in?

I'm not asking for help to solve a problem here.  It's working, and it sounds Just Fine to my ears.  I just wonder why nobody produces a nicer, more premium version of this device.  It seems like the ones on the market are aimed more at PA systems than for home stereo."
audiophile,"I bought a pair of monitors and noticed something new in my music listening routine. 

I don't know how to describe it properly, but even if I'm playing a song at full volume, which is *really* fucking loud, I almost can't hear it from out of the room if the door's closed. If I open the door, it's  like an overwhelming avalanche of sound that fills the whole house. I don't have any acoustic insulation inside the room. 

What I find strange about this is that before I got the monitors I had only cheap and dull built-in computer speakers and somehow the sound bled through the walls. The computer speakers are not nearly as loud as my monitors at 1/10 of their capacity.

Is there a name for this phenomenon? How do I understand and explain this?

Thanks!"

I'm looking to upgrade but looking for some ideas and pointers on making the most out of the space. Current setup is Polk speakers on stands at the extreme corners. Rear flush-mount speakers (2) would probably be better with ones that come down and can be pointed. Looking to add front high speakers too (note: I have a number of recordings mixed for surround so looking to be able to listen to those and traditional stereo mixes). The media niche is handy because I can hide the sub behind the tv, but very limiting in many other ways.

audiophile,"A few weeks ago I said Tidal wasn't worth the money and you can't really hear the difference enough to justify the extra cost. I was wrong. 
  
At that time my main amp was a really nice Onkyo Integra 1802. I have since swapped in my NAD C355BEE. What a difference that made. The detail I can now hear in the Tidal master tracks is astonishing. Sound stage is better. Best of all, the dynamics are much better with Tidal. The comparison isn't just based on swapping in a better amp but direct comparisons between Tidal, Deezer, Amazon, and Spotify. With a better amp it's a night and day difference in the streaming platforms. 
I was wrong. Tidal is the best."

audiophile,"Hello everyone, I am fairly new to the audiophile world. I did post this question on the Grado channel but this is a much larger community and hopefully it reaches a larger chunk of knowledge folks who might be able to share their thoughts. 

I just bought my first audiophile headphones and I'm very excited. (GS3000X)

But because I'm not as informed, I have been reading that people should test their headphones to make sure they're not defective. Of course I have no reference on what or how to test so I found this website which runs through a set of pre-recorded tests. 

https://www.audiocheck.net/soundtests_headphones.php

Now before I mention my concerns, I don't even know if this test is valid and legitimate and can reliably test headphones. I just didn't know where else, or how else, to go about that. There is a sea of information and it can be overwhelming for a complete newcomer. 

Anyway, two particular tests stood out as having a somewhat inferior outcome.

The two tests in question are the Bass Shaker (from the link above), where I hear a slight rattle at the very beginning. No rattle after that. The second one is the left right articulation (also from the link above). When the test is playing on the left side per their instructions, I still hear audio bleed on the right side and vice versa. Is that normal until the headphones are broken in? Or is that defective? Or did I damage them by running these tests before breaking them in? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated"

audiophile,"Years ago when I first got into hifi I googled a lot of ‚Äúbest songs to test speakers,‚Äù etc.  I remember there was this one song that was by a saxophone quartet which, if you listened to on basic speakers/headphones, sounds like a hideous wall of noise.  It was almost painful.  But when you had high quality gear, the saxophones sort of separated and you could almost hear where each player was standing in the mix, and suddenly it sounded like good music.  

I‚Äôve tried to recreate the google search to find that song hundreds of times, but I cannot for the life of me find it.

I‚Äôve been using AIAIAI TMA2 and Beoplay H? (can‚Äôt remember the model, the ones with a cord) for some years and I loved them - mostly because of their design. I also liked that they had a decent sound - at least it seemed so. However, I‚Äôve recently come across the new AirPods Pro and while I love the practicality of tiny Bluetooth earphones, I was also pleasantly surprised by their sound. You‚Äôll probably laugh me off but I would even say that the basses and lows are more enjoyable with AirPods. I am a classic consumer - no other equipment, no special music formats, just plug in and listen on Spotify. 

How come the music sounds better on AirPods? Am I doing something wrong? I‚Äôd like to enjoy listening to the music with my Beoplay‚Äôs too again, but the sound is just kinda shallow and cheap-ish, compared to AirPods."

Hi, I have started to dismantle my HiFi setup as I don't feel like I have been using it to it's potential for quite some time. (Arcam amp, Spendor S8e speakers) Mainly due to the fact that once our daughter was born we pushed the speakers close to the wall (either side of the fire place)... Although they still sound great, the soundstage has never been the same (obviously).

We have been using a Naim Mu So 2 in the kitchen for the last year and very happy with it. The plan is to use the naim in the living room (buying a second hand gen 1 QB for the kitchen), most of our music currently comes from streaming services (sorry!).
We do still want to listen and buy records though, and the change of layout in the living room means it will be a bit easier to do so comfortably, which brings me onto the main question.

What turntable would be suitable to use with the Naim MuSo 2? It accepts an analogue input via the 3.5 jack.
We would need to have a phono amp to use our current TT or we could sell the TT and buy something with an internal preamp.

Option 1) use our current TT which is a pink triangle LPT.
The LPT has not been used for a year or so and would need a good service including a new bearing.
The arm is a Roksan Tabriz (cart may need replacing).
We of course would need a phono amp too. The LPT also has an external power system etc.

Option 2) buy a Rega Planar 1 plus, sell the LPT and arm or option 2.a sell the LPT use the arm on the p1? :/

Also open to other suggestions.

I am of course not expecting the P1 + MuSo to sound as nice as the old LPT+Spendor setup. But I am interested on your thoughts in regards to the above 2 options and how much ""better"" the LPT would be vs the P1 when used with the MuSo 2. (I assume the type of preamp would have an effect on this answer, but assume it would be a mid range unit)

The main reason for ""downgrading"" our system is for simplicity and space constraints, the p1 certainly would certainly fit the bill but I am not too against the idea of adding a phono amp into the mix."

I currently have my setup in a very large room, but am planning for the future with this setup and will most likely end up in a much smaller room, avg. apartment living room size. 
I listen to genres that lean a little bass heavy if that is helpful. Also, none of these components have been purchased yet, so open to relevant substitutes as well! Around $3,000usd budget.
Would appreciate any help, thanks!"

audiophile,"I'm in the process of deciding between the ht-a9 + sw5 sub and a 5.1.2 traditional setup and was hoping I could get some input to help me decide.



I'm new to ht and am using a $140 yamaha sound bar which I am 80% happy with, but just looking for a better experience. It will be used for gaming (ps5/rtx3080), movies and music on an lg c1.



Room is quite small (3m x 5m) with corridoor running down the back of the room behind the couch.  Ceiling height is 2.4m and is flat.



I will be installing the 5.1.2 myself and don't mind the work or the speaker wires if it will produce a better result in the end. The atmos speakers are upfiring and not sure if I'll place them on top the speakers or ceiling level, either front or side.



The components are:



Denon x1700h

Monitor audio monitor 300 towers

Monitor audio monitor c150 center

Monitor audio monitor 100 bookshelf

Monitor mrw10 subwoofer

Monitor bronze Ams atmos speakers



I have 2 options



1) 2nd hand a9 with sw5 sub for 1700(usd) with 7 months  sony warranty from private seller using paypal so there is some protection in the event it's broken. If that becomes unavailable, brand new will cost 2220(usd) for both.



Setup as: firestick/ps5/rtx3080 -&gt; c1 -&gt; a9



2) The 5.1.2 setup I listed above all brand new for 2100(usd) + wiring



Setup as: firestick/ps5/rtx3080 -&gt; x1700 -&gt; c1



I've actually demoed both systems but with a x3700h instead of a x1700h and no atmos speakers.



I was really impressed with the monitor audio speakers. They were setup inside a 6m x6m mini theatre.



The a9 setup sounds good also, but it wasn't really close in terms of overall impression.



I need to mention however the a9 was in a less than ideal setup. It was at a sony store inside a shopping center so there was ambient noise of varying levels of volume coming in from the entrance and also there was no flat ceiling surface. It was maybe 3-4m high and had pipes and other things of that nature running along it. As a result I could hear basically zero height effects.



The positioning of the speakers was also imo not optimal. They were setup in a 2.5m x2m rectangle with the rears being directly behind the sofa (placed on the edge of the 2m length) on the corners of the rectangle. As a result of the close proximity of the rears they drowned out the fronts and had an imbalance around a ratio of 30/70 f/r. I tried lowering the rear volume to match the fronts but that caused the immersion to drop of fairly significantly.



Additional information about the sony store setup:

The front and rear of the setup had walls, the right side had the desk + register setup 1m away and to the left was the entrance to the store about 6m away.



I would have no problems deciding for myself if the a9 was setup in a more ideal situation, but I can't find another one within the same state.



I really wanted to like the a9 but my experience with it found it underwheling. It was immersive but not in the way it has been described by many others especially with the missing vertical atmos. However I acknowledge it was likely due to the setup, but not sure how much better it would sound in an ideal situation.



Other things to consider: when gaming and running immersive ae, I'm not sure if this will cause siginificant sound delay with the a9. The x1700h shouldn't have this problem as all devices will be plugged directly into it.

Warranty 7 months for a9 vs 3 yrs for the denon and 5 yrs for the monitor audio speakers.



Atm I leaning towards the 5.1.2 because I'm very impressed with my experience, but going for the a9 seems like a bit of a gamble. I could buy the a9 and sell if not impressed but prefer not to go through that hassle.



Any helpful input or insight is appreciated"

audiophile,"Hello everybody, recently I have been interested in having a good audio quality, I bought a KZ EDK PRO iems to use as headphones, I use my phone and Spotify to listen to music, what recommendation would you give me?

audiophile,"Hi all, hope that I post in the right place. Am an audiophile, although I'm ok to compromise (lossless quality always, but 16/44.1 is fine most of the time...). My main living room setup is fine, now I want to improve my office room PC setup for the occasional **music listening &amp; movies experience** *(stereo only, 1940-1970 movies mostly).*

Currently I'm using Audioengine A2+, which I really don't like. My main speakers in living room are B&amp;W 803D4, I like neutrality. For the PC I was looking at monitor speakers like the Yamaha HS7, would be the best value I can find in Japan.

As for the audio interface/DAC, the Focurite Scarlett Solo seems to be excellent value, although poor to drive some headphones such as my HD800s (but I have the HDVD600 headphone amp for that).

Overall that's 63,000 jpy + some balanced TRS cables for the lot (about 450$): what's your opinion on this set, is that good compromise or do you recommend better value components? Thank you for your time."

These headphones will mainly be used in a wired setting on my PC.

I was considering the Klipsch Reference 5 Dolby system, but I‚Äôm not sure what else is out there that might be better. The system will run through my Sony TA-AX380 receiver until I can upgrade it. It will be used with my turntable and television.

audiophile,"I'm working from home a lot now, and wanting decent speakers as wearing headphones all day is getting uncomfortable. It'll mostly be for music while I work, but I may also be connecting a google tv dongle to the monitor to use as a second tv (so 2 inputs usb and hdmi/optical needed). 
I was thinking of going for a smaller dac, amp and passive speakers, but leaning towards powered speakers for simplicity. A bonus would be if it has spotify connect/google chromecast builtin.

The very upper end of my budget would be the KEF LSX II's, but ideally I can find something cheaper (half the price). Any ideas for powered speakers, or an amp/dac/passive speakers combo."
audiophile," 

I'm currently looking to buy my first audio setup. Also will soon add a turntable (LP-120). I'm new in this bookshelf thing and I've never use an amplifier before. I understand how it functions and know using it would allow me to upgrade my setup if necessary.

Anyway, I have the following questions.

a) I love listening to rock, instrumentals, pink floyd, daft punk, tool. Which speaker would favor me?

b) In terms of Soundstage and Imaging, Which sounds better?

c) Which speaker would you pick?

PS: Thank you anyone who helps me here. Really having a tough time choosing one.

Bluestone Node (AirPlay or Qubuzz stream) or Vinyl.

I shall begin by saying that I have a range of speakers from some small Sony speakers to a Yamaha DXR 10 so I have a relative understanding of speaker quality. 

I‚Äôm looking to include a subwoofer into my home audio system, I am preferably looking for a passive Bose speaker of between 8-12 inch but from my brief research I haven‚Äôt been able to find any that will suit what I need. Something of similar quality, style and age will be appropriate, preferably black wood affect with a cloth speaker cover but this isn‚Äôt a need if something of the right price and speaker type comes along from your recommendations.

audiophile,"Setup: I use a Pro-ject Xpression turntable with an Ortofon 2m Blue cartridge. The stylus is around 9 years old.

The problem: when listening to certain records with massive amounts of reverb (like dub), I sometimes get a static-y hiss at the reverb-iest moments. There is no skipping, but the noise is noticeable and irritating. This is an issue I've experienced across multiple records, including mint/new records.

I'm trying to figure out the source of the issue and how to correct it. My first thought is that my stylus is wearing down and needs to be replaced. I'm not really sure what the expected lifespan of a stylus is or what signs to watch out for regarding stylus wear. My other thought is it might be an issue with the tracking force and that increasing the weight/force might help. However I'm concerned about screwing up records with too high of tracking force. Obviously the issue could have to due with the quality of the vinyl pressing, but I haven't noticed any pattern between the issue and quality/appearance of the record.

Any advice is appreciated."

I like the mobility of connecting to my amplifier via Bluetooth but the sounds is noticeable better when connected via the 1m USB to DAC cable (amplifier has build in DAC). So my questions:

audiophile,"I haven't heard anywhere about this issue, so I come to you guys for help. It's been plaguing me for some time now, and I have to fix this problem before it ends up damaging my audio monitors or headphones.

I've had an Audient Evo 4 audio interface for quite a while now (almost 2 years I'd say?), and **I've never really had any problems with it**. That is until I bought my new GPU, an MSI RTX 3060.

* For context, I've had a GPU installed on my PC before (it was basically a whole different system back then, different RAM, MOBO, CPU, everything is new now), that was an ASUS GTX 1050 Ti.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now for the actual problem itself**, once I installed the GPU on my PC, the audio started to crackle a little bit. It happens ocasionally, it's now like static or anything, it's just pops that happen every few secconds, like if you have an audio clip that starts playing without a crossfade on your DAW.

* I've experienced this issue more profoundly in COD Warzone, but it can happen pretty much anywhere.
* The issue became way worse when I tried using the NVIDIA Broadcast software, once I applied the background removal effect on my webcam and ran DOOM Eternal, the audio was a mess...

&amp;#x200B;

From what I can tell, my headphones are not the issue, I've p**lugged it into the MOBO and it performs perfectly**. Also the bitrate is set to 44.1k and 64 samples (I've tried 128, 256, didn't solve the issue).

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone help me out with this? I reinstalled the drivers, did everything I could to try and fix it, but I can't manage to get it to go away. I don't know if I am posting in the right subreddit, but seeing as this is an audio issue, maybe I can get some help from someone who have experienced it before..."

I have tried the PC1002 with multiple DACs. Given the age of the power amp, I have looked at rebuild kits. Capacitors affect power output but do they also affect tone? Are there any critical internal components on a power amp that you would look at replacing that do directly affect tone?"
audiophile,"I went to test two streamers (Naim XS2 and Bluesound Node) using only digital out to a +$30k Wilson + Pathos setup. The seller claimed that there's a notable difference and I thought bs, but it was absolutely gigantic. I'm a digital is digital kind of guy, but of course one can color the sound, but bit perfect is an easy thing and jitter etc doesn't matter with proper implementations. The Node made the set sound like crap to be honest and the Naim had a strong Naim house sound like the amps do (very punchy, articulate and engaging). So what are they doing to change the sound? Just some digital filtering that drastically changes the sound? Isn't it a problem if the streamer adds the coloration and then the amp does the same again? Seems like a strange approach to me even if it does sound very good in certain ways."

PC (music and games):

Adi2-DAC FS + Audeze LCD2 Classic (music) or Sennheiser HD700 (games) (however, I listen to music quite a bit while sitting, so I often have some wireless headphones on)

Living room:

LG C1 TV (movies, series, sports):

   * It worked ok but adjusting settings and such was very cumbersome, it required manual re-indexing of the HDD when I added new tracks, and i‚Äôd rather not keep a keyboard in my living room
   * The recommended iOS app I bought to control it remotely was poor in terms of usability and reliability
   * I‚Äôd be willing to try other Pi music streaming OS options if they‚Äôre truly easy to use and a high quality experience
* Bluesound Node
   * Researched this and was sounding pretty promising until I read lots of complaints about the local music library capabilities (sounds like they were treated as an afterthought to the streaming capabilities)
   * Would love to hear if people have had positive experiences with BluOS and local hard drive streaming
* Macbook
   * Not ideal but I *could* use my Macbook as an impermanent streamer (connecting it to the DAC and HDD when sitting down for a listening session) if there‚Äôs a compelling software setup
   * Spotify Connect covers half my needs but given that you still can‚Äôt control the iTunes/Music app remotely via iPhone for local file playback, I‚Äôd need an alternate solution for that
* Roon
   * No Spotify support and would prefer to avoid another subscription
* Wiim Mini Streamer
   * No external HDD support

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks so much!"

audiophile,"Hello,

Indochine is one of the biggest French bands that celebrates its fortieth anniversary with a series of concerts in 2022, including the Stade de France with more than 87,000 people.  The concert in Lyon was recorded in IMAX and will be shown in IMAX theaters from November 23.

On November 15, their first album L'Aventurier celebrates its 40th anniversary.

This is the occasion to compare different versions including vinyl, cassette, cd, streaming, SACD.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a2bdtcl4azz91.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a093f7e511f5d327c2eb580bf57e820a7117de6a

But, a curiosity for this album concerning the 45rpm vinyl edition that was released in Sweden with under the same reference the premix version and the final mix.

The hardest thing is to know which version you have, the only difference, apart from the listening, is to look at the width of the silent zone in the center of the record, as shown in the picture below:

https://preview.redd.it/ouhzu1k9azz91.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6535344a0d6f1b3f8fb131d59135bcedde841564

Even if it's not your favorite style of music, it allows you to see the evolution of the album's mix between the premix and the final mix, to hear the evolution between the distribution of the voices and the music, the tonal balance.

You can listen to these two versions among the 8 other versions [**here**](https://magicvinyldigital.net/2022/11/14/indochine-l-aventurier-40-years-anniversary-review-vinyl-cd-qobuz-cassette-sacd-mix-and-premix/).

Another curiosity is the 5.1 mix of two tracks of this album available on a SACD compilation.

Otherwise, one of the great positive points is that this album has not been impacted by the War loudness.

Good listening"
audiophile,"I recently tried to use the Dirac Live app on my iphone to delete the filter applied to slot 2, the software bugged out and started giving slot error messages. At this point, I could no longer connect to Dirac Live on the app or on my PC.

To anyone who is having this issue, a factory reset did not work for me. What did work was turning off HDMI CEC in the AVR settings of my Onkyo TX RZ50. After doing this my Dirac Live software on my PC immediately connected. 

Not sure why this fixed the issue for me, but it did. Please respond if this helps anyone who is having this issue."
audiophile,"Considering a mytek Brooklyn or liberty DAC. I currently have a bluesound node and I‚Äôd love to upgrade my DAC and streamer at some point, but I was going to start with my DAC.

audiophile,"Hey guys just starting to get into the land of audiophillia and had some questions.  I normally play electronic dance music and was wondering what some good options are for a home system.  Not really trying to break the bank but something loud with good value.

Thank you."
audiophile,"Because of this sub, moved on from sound bar, best decision I've ever made.

           Current setup:
Denon AVR-x3600h
2x Klipsch RP-8000f
6x SVS prime elevation (2 surrounds, 2 rear, 2 height)

            Room size:
12ftX12ftX12ft

             Use:
50/50 music and movies
____________________________________________________
            Will add:
Klipsch RP-504c ($400, not many other options)

            Last piece of the puzzle?????

1- RFL speedwoofer 10s MKii ($450)
2- Monolith M-10 V2 ($550)
3- Monolith M-210 ($1000)
4 - Rythmik LV12M ($700)

Main option right now is the RSL speedwoofer.
The Monolith 210 seems like the best bang for buck as it gives 1000w and goes as low as 16Hz.

The Monolith 210, however, is a 160 lbs huge box....
Will adding a secondary speedwoofer, M-10, or LV12M in the future match the power of one 210?

Which is the best option in your opinion?
Open for suggestion within the stated price range. Limited floor space, a tower subwoofer like the 210 could work. Looking to get bang for buck."
audiophile,"Getting my home studio set up again for the first time since before the pandemic but a few years ago I somehow lost one of my Rokit 5s... I'm considering replacing it instead of splashing out on a new pair of monitors, but it seems the Rokit 5 G3 is all but erased from history and instead there's the Rokit Classic 5. Just wondering if they are identical/similar enough to the G3 series to use as a replacement?

Thanks"
audiophile,"I bought my metas almost two years ago, at that time I lived in a house, and was totally in live with them. Six months ago I moved to an apartment and the room is larger, (about 14x23 feet, though I have the speakers against the long wall, offset, there are some pictures) and I just find that they aren't as engaging as I found them before the move. Part of that is that I don't crank them very often due to having neighbors and I find that the LS50s need to reach a certain volume level before they really create that magic that they're famous for.

I'm just looking for a ""bigger"" sounding speaker. I have a sub, and SVS SB 2000 pro, and the power is ample, through a Cambridge Audio 851 integrated, which is being used in power amp mode since I acquired a NAD c658 as a streamer. I live in Denmark, so the used market is limited, as I did spend some time looking for vintage JBLs or something- I love the sound of 12"" paper drivers, (and had to abandon a pair of 1974 L100s when I moved here 10 years ago,) but the used JBL market is laughably expensive, and as for contemporary alternatives, the price is a little much for me to handle at this time, looking at something like a KLH model 5, 
The only dealer of the Lintons here is online only, so they have a no questions asked 30 day return period, but I guess what I'm asking is, should I hold on to my money now and work towards a more definitive upgrade down the line? Obviously the in home audition is great, but I'm also really good at talking myself into new stuff.

audiophile,"Had some time to kill Friday afternoon and had a listen to the new (to me) KEF Blade 2 Meta.  It's been on my dream listen list for awhile.  The store had it powered with a McIntosh MC1502 tube amp.  The preamp wasn't set up yet but they quickly assembled with a Bluesound Node.  Definitely a mismatch and it showed slightly. 

https://preview.redd.it/w14su5rxkxz91.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7649bd19b6c31c328a5320a79e73702545595d9a

The obvious thing is the massive soundstage.  BIG, BIG and BIGGER than I've experienced in awhile.  Don't know if this is something I chase or want but it's noticeable.  The presentation is slightly laid back and the sales said, it's the combination of the amp and the speaker.   

That MC1502 looks tiny in the picture but it's double a MC275 size.  A lot of eye candy but it didn't give me a very tube experience.  Maybe it's the combination of the Bluesound and the KEF.  The KEF strikes me as more neutral and revealing speaker and the Bluesound when I owned one was very slightly veiled compared to my current streamer.  

https://preview.redd.it/p1a94nynlxz91.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ede4e73cdbd4fb32e15e9479e474ed719ddf19

One thing that my demo track revealed was that bass is strong with the KEF speakers.  This track by Percy Heath overpowered the room.  The room acoustics were not tuned correctly and it was definitely affecting the enjoyment slightly.  This track has some very low notes for acoustic instruments.  I suggested to the dealer to install a MEN220 before the Saturday open house showcase.  

When I went home and listened to the same track on my own system (Spendor A6 with dual REL S/510 subs), My room has a DSP to tune the bass correctly and compensate for the room. the bass notes were much clearer with proper delineation of the plucking and nuances of the notes.  Way more enjoyable but the potential for the KEF Blade 2 to not need a sub is there.  

I'd LOVE to get the KEF Blade 2 meta for a in home demo to really see if they are for me.  The look is subjective and probably would work in my loft industrial space.  More so than my traditional Spendor speakers.  Alas, if I was in the market for a 40k speaker, I'd still want a Focal Sopra or a used Utopia just for looks alone."
audiophile,"So I had a 2.1 setup with Bowers &amp; Wilkins 606 S2‚Äôs. I then upgraded to a 5.1 adding Paradigm 800F‚Äôs as my fronts with a Paradigm Premier 600C center and moved the B&amp;W‚Äôs as my surrounds. Anthem MRX540 receiver.  This is my home theater set up in my living room. 
So I was thinking of buying some cheap speakers for my bedroom for a small set up there. 
Then I thought maybe I should move my B&amp;W‚Äôs upstairs and get some cheaper bookshelfs as my surrounds for the living room. 
My questions are:
1. Is it better to keep the B&amp;W‚Äôs as my surrounds? 
2. Would it make sense to replace them with cheaper speakers and if so, what would you recommend for surrounds for my set up.

audiophile,"My first audioshow, so I'm not ""fluent"" with the exercise. The show was setup by a well know audio shop in a hotel. Here are my novice impressions:

(I could not select the music myself of course. )

Off all the things I heard the combo Sonus Faber + McIntosh was the most impressive. Everything was right: soundstage, lows, mediums, highs, details.... I could not find criticism on the sound.  The room itself was idiotic: nearly full dark, I assume to highlight the blue displays of McIntosh... There were top range floor standers (could not read the reference, there was no light) and bookshelves Electra Amator III that were amazing (5500‚Ç¨ each...) they played a Trentem√∏ler track (Evil Dub) that is super bass heavy and those diminutive speaker sounded like a concert stage. 

We were shown the smaller wireless devices from McIntosh but playing them after the reference McIntosh + Sonus was probably a huge salesman mistake. 

Two different rooms had Wilson's and I found that their highs were disproportionately powerful compared to the rest, don't know if that a thing with Wilson's, it was my first time hearing them. It was especially unpleasant on a jazz track with a very expensive piano that would become cringely powerful above a certain octave. 

The Klipschorns were nice but they played only old jazz recordings and I suspect the limits of the recording were far bellow the quality of the speakers unfortunately.

Focal/Naim was nice with the presentation of the first naim turn table. Sound was great but was less ""wow"" than Sonus Faber. I don't know how to phrase it better. Everything was right but somehow the Focals were bigger in size than the Sinus while the Sonus were bigger in sound. Rooms were very different, it's also Naim vs McIntosh, so it surely not the last word. One thing I can say: quality of vynil was nearly equal to digital which surprised me (I'm on the digital side of the fence)

There was also an artisan presenting audiophile grade Ethernet switch in a very small room with a lot of eye contact and I had a lot of trouble to listen quietly and not laugh. 

A couple of rooms played magnetic bands (not sure how it's called in English, sorry) and sounded good, I'm still puzzled that it exists :-)

All in all a very pleasant visit, I hope to do that against soon."
audiophile,"Okay so I have taken the speaker apart, to replace the foam surround, and now I need to figure out the specs of the speaker itself and the amp.

I need the w output of the amp, as well as peak w of the amp and the power needed to run it, so I can match a new amp to the speaker for the car

As well as this I need the w of the speaker as well as the RMS and peak wattage. As well as the ideal cabanete volume.

The only information I have to go on is what it says on the amp, it's says 230v 50/60hz and 150 va
 And I think somewhere else it said it was a 100w sub, however I don't know what part this was referring to.

I know this may be a hard question due to lack of information but it would be cool if you guys could help me figure it out!"

audiophile,"Hi All,

So I have XOnar DG Soundcard in my PC, that runs out over optical to a Beresford Bushmaster DAC and then into my sennys/ or other amp (via splitter) for room sound.

My question is: Equaliser. The XONAR DG software EQ does nothing (doesent even seem to control volume)

What am I missing, what can I get that would give me an EQ onto this SPDIF data stream before it hits either of my amps? Or am I missing something?

Thanks,

Matt"

audiophile," 

I decided to also post in this subreddit so I can get more insight. I recently got the Yu passive 4 speakers and Beyerdynamic DT900PROX headphones. This is for my PC desk setup.

I would love to get an amp/DAC combo all in one to which I can connect both devices. Where I, with a switch could change between headphones and speakers. (Bluetooth bonus points).

I got my sights on this equipment: Topping DX5 or DX7, Ifi Zen Blue V2, Grace m900, Audioengine D1, Schiit Asgard 3 with DAC... The budget is around 700 USD

audiophile,"Hi!

I hope it is okay to ask this and have discussion with people that have similar setups...

TLDR: playing high/res audio through apple music makes low-end frequencies muddy/distorted and sound from the speakers is not clear.

So i am a bit confused as to why i have this problem occurring. I have the following setup:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†16"" MBP M1 Pro
‚Ä¢	‚Å†scarlett solo DAC connected to two active speakers through 6,5mm (from the scarlett) to XLR to the speakers.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†the two speakers are Genelecs (doesnt matter, happens with another setup that i have as well)

I use apple music due to its lossless alternative to listen to my music. However, the sound coming out from the external speakers connected to the soundcard is distorted/muddy and not clear. I have tried going into the MIDI setting for the mac to update the soundcard's sample rate setting. I have also used an app called LosslessSwitcher (https://github.com/vincentneo/LosslessSwitcher) that switches the sample rates automatically between songs. However, it has not resolved the distorted sound.

I have also tried with two more DACs,

‚Ä¢	‚Å†SMSL su8
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Fiio e10k

Both of them produce the same distortion when playing apple music lossless quality. However, once i use an older mac that i have, that is an intel-machine mac, everything sounds fine, no distortion, no problems. Once i connect from my MBP that runs the apple chips, i have the distortion. Playing lossless through the built in speakers of the laptop sounds correct. Using the laptop's Auxiliary port that has an internal DAC works fine as well, but once i connect to an external DAC using the USBC ports, i have the distortion.

It is such a frustrating problem. I don't think having a discussion with apple support would solve this problem as they would just recommend me trying different ports, reinstalling etc. It's just not viable because it makes no sense that after trying different ports, different DACs, it still sounds distorted. But functions correctly when using the aux or the laptop speakers.

Some very similar things I've found online:

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253476970

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253778521?page=2

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253134937

I'll attach a demo where you can hear the problem: https://imgur.com/a/1DkLBFA

In the video, I am switching between the soundcard, and the internal laptop speakers. You can hear that the bass is distorted and muddy when outputting sound from the speakers.

Note that i am only getting this problem from Apple Music. I have played music from an application called Cider (https://cider.sh/#) and spotify, all that works fine. No distortion. But note that cider does not support apples lossless streaming. Also, if i turn of the lossless alternative in Apple Music, it sounds fine.

I just tried playing lossless through qobuz and everything there sound fine. 

All insight/help is appreciated. If there are any more questions, just ask away.

Kind regards"
audiophile,"I never understood why do Genelec recommend huge subwoofer for setups 5.1 and bigger

For example they say if you have 834x, you gotta take 7360 for 2 channel listening. But for 5.1 and up = 7370
For 835x its 7380 

They say that some technology unravels better like that

However i found people who use smaller subs and they never even mention that they should‚Äôve gotten a bigger sub. And that they are lacking something. I even saw some very experienced guy/mixer on some forum, he has pair of 8351 and he uses 2x7360 (so not even 7370, not to mention that you ‚Äúgotta‚Äù have 7380 which costs 4k)

So is this rule not so important?

I am not a music producer, but i am for sure planing to mix something in the future. Maybe I will be mixing in 5.1 as well. But i definitely want a subwoofer for better music experience and for movies."
audiophile,"The only requirements I have on a amplifier is that it have a built music player, DLNA and Chrome cast. Of course it must have built in hires DAC and decent power output. Probably a class-d amplifier. 

From my surfpad I can then use any music streaming service wich have a app with Chrome cast or DLNA capability.

Is there something like that out there?

I am reluctant to pay money for ton of inputs I never use."
audiophile,"I was really looking forward to hearing some high end setups. And there were plenty, some I imagine touching the $1,000,000 mark. However I walked away confused about a couple things:


* The volume level was at a 3 or 4 out of 10 in most rooms. I can understand the appeal of hearing a detailed sound stage and high fidelity even at low volumes, but I was surprised that this was an almost universal preference in the 20 or so setups I saw. I like to feel it in my chest and like I'm seeing the artist live. 

* The song selection was... boring. And very few vendors took any requests. It was 90% classical, jazz and quiet singer songwriter stuff. I was expecting a little more diversity or at least the opportunity for one of the people in the room to pick a song. 

*A ton of snake oil products both being sold and used in these setups. Not surprised, but funny to me. 

Due to this I walked away feeling pretty meh about setups that based on price and what on paper should have been amazing. Does anybody else that goes to these shows think they're a bit uptight and stale? Turn up the volume a bit, put on some rock 'n roll or electronic music once in awhile. 

In sum, I expected to be blown away, instead I'm perfectly happy with my consumer grade setup right on the value/quality slope."
audiophile,"I just dropped +$600 on the Audioengine A2+ plus subwoofer. Is it the best desktop speaker I can get in that price range? After making the purchase, I saw some negative reviews on Reddit and now I'm questioning myself. Thank y'all!"
audiophile,"Hi,
after years of not caring much about hifi gear I‚Äôm kind of surprised that the trend for 2.1 systems with small speakers (satellites) seems to be completely over. Why? 
I agree that the old Bose systems aren‚Äôt an audiophiles dream, but why wasn‚Äôt the idea developed to the next level?"
audiophile,"Apologies in advance if this is the wrong place to ask this question but I'm looking for some advice on what kind of system selection and layout I should choose.

The backroom in my house is very long and narrow, 11 feet by 19 feet. One end of the room is the wood fireplace, your classic weathered brick look, and the other end of the room meets with the kitchen at the peninsula countertop. One side of the room has the backdoor that opens up to our deck.

I would like to put speakers at the fireplace end of the room so that music fills the space and continues into the kitchen. I also thought this would be a great opportunity to incorporate outdoor speakers, one on either side of the deck. I'd like the option to play music on just the indoor speakers, just the outdoor speakers, or both.

I was thinking id just get a simple 5.1 system with multiple zones, one wall speaker on either side of the fireplace, the sub and receiver on one side of the fireplace, and one outdoor speaker on either side of the deck. So I'd only use 4 of the 5 speaker channels but oh well. 

Looking for thoughts and any feedback on my plan."

My very 1st audio show and it was a blast. Super friendly and very knowledgeable people. I was greatly impressed by the fact that most of the vendors took their time to explain their wares even though I do not fit the archetype of the people that can afford these insanely priced rigs. 

Highlights of the show: Geshelli Labs cool cool people had a blast talking to gramps and his granddaughter about their new upcoming Class A/B integrated.

But by far the biggest highlight was Andrew Jones himself!!! He was giving lectures on his design philosophy and hopw he went about designing the PointSource10s. He then gave a demo at the end of each session. Room 532 was always packed with folk waiting hear him speak and listen to his new speakers. Believe me when I say that these things at just $4k/pair is on par with and beats many speakers 10x their price. Be on the lookout for them.

My ranking of the rooms: 

1. Mofi's Andrew Jones PointSource10
2. Matterhorn Audio Group. Small Towers: Kroma Atelier Stella Xtreme $34,200
   1. (2a) Matterhorn Audio Group Fink Team Kim $12,990
3. Perlisten S7t $9k
4. BMR Audio group 
5. dyptique planars

Rest of the speakers were mostly ok at ridiculous prices at least to me. Final take away is this: enjoy whatever system you have it's probably better than you give it credit. To my ears the most expensive room: United Home audio at damn near $900k was also one of the most underwhelming just ok sounding rooms!"

audiophile,"I've asked my neighbor several times, and he's not heard anything. The odd thing is you can very clearly hear it coming from the front door if you stand outside a bit, but in terms of sound escaping from my wall to his, he doesn't hear anything (and also listens to music which is good).

 I'm more worried about the downstairs neighbor than anything. I also don't really listen to music loudly as I don't sit far away from my setup, 70\~DB or so is more than enough for me"

audiophile,"Hey all, new to the sub so apologies and the area in general so apologies for my poor description. I have been searching for ages to try and find a product and I cannot find one or they are insanely expensive. I am looking for a way to take the aux output from my pc into an EQ with basic controls (like bass, treble, mid would be nice) rather than the whole spectrum. The caveat is that I would like control over the two channels (which aux treats as L and R) uniquely. This is due to the fact that I am running 2 speakers off each channel in my amp and they are all different, so the sound is not very balanced on each side and I am hoping to balance this out a little. The only idea I have had is to maybe get a splitter from aux to rca then have a splitter on each of those rca cables to make 2x2 channel rca inputs, but this would cause some signal degradation I believe. I will add that my amp does feature a built in EQ but I believe it only works for usb/sd storage input. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!"

audiophile,"I'm very much on the budget side of things. My barely not dumb (new) 1080 50' TV has HDMI in and digital optical out. And it still works with my 15yo Sony receiver's optical in which I picked up for $20. The optical cable was $5 online. I  have limped along with my 5.1 no-name system along with its grotesque bass saturation, and subsequently without the woofer, horribly thin sound. These are two Panasonic bookshelf speakers well within the power and impedance constraints of the amplifier. Driver's, tweeters, a good time was had by all. These speakers get powerfully loud and sound like they're just getting warmed up. The vocals are front and center in movies. Having a thin, reedy 5.0 system we had to put captions on, now with these speakers they're whispering in my ear, not shouting from a chasm. Captions optional. I'm playing funk on these things and everything is so gosh darned warm. It feels like a big hug. Maybe, maybe a subwoofer would add something to the experience. Buts it's so clean as is. I'm at $300 total for the entire TV/audio setup. $70 of that is audio, the speakers and receiver and cables. Buying used is where it's at. There is literally no way this sound only has $70 value. It's just no one knows there's a $5 cable out there."

I offered to put on their music through my hifi setup instead and they were all amazed by how much better it sounded. A few of them now are asking for my help in putting together their own stereo.

I recently purchased a Kawai MP11SE. I love it and would highly recommend just FYI. I am playing with Sennheiser HD660S headphones. I don‚Äôt mind the headphones, they sound great. However, I want the option of using an amp. 

My price range is $200-600. I was recommended Yamaha HS5 amplifiers by a musician friend of mine for all around good home use (not studio use). I trust his opinion greatly, but as per the Soviet saying, ‚Äútrust, but verify‚Äù.

audiophile,"I'm Apple-based. Trying not to move to Qubuz or Tidal. I want to get the most out of Apple Music's streaming service. I want audiophile-quality playback. For now, I have a MacBook Pro connected to a DAC which I drive via the Remote app on my iPhone. But the sound is less than stellar; the CD version sounds better.   


I'd like to know if a streamer would improve the sound or just allow me to replace the Apple laptop and its limitations of bitrate flipping, etc. I recognize that Apple hasn't (yet?) release the APIs that would allow, say, Audirvana to take over for the Music app. People talk about the Blue Node and the like, which of course can only utilize 48KHz at best through ApplePlay, which is fine, if the quality is better than what I'm getting out of the Music app. I doubt the Blue Node DAC is better than what I have, from what I've heard.  


Is there even an answer to this question(s)? Is a streamer of some sort an immediate upgrade? Or are we Apple Music users just in a holding pattern, waiting for our dear Apple to get the message?"

audiophile,"So I have my laptop connected to my TV as my main monitor with 3.5mm speakers plugged in my laptop as my audio source. I am now planning to upgrade and add a DAC and connect it to my TV so audio source will come directly from the TV, not the laptop. (will upgrade my speakers ofc).

My question is, is there any point in doing this, or will I just be wasting my money? Since the laptop's still the main source of power of everything that's connected by an HDMI.

I am assuming the HDMI connection just voids the FLAC quality."
audiophile,"I was recalling a time where i replaced my stock radio that didn't even have an aux output on an old jeep to a ""High Tech"" USB/Bluetooth/Aux radio that cost me about 300$, the first thing i noticed was music sounded empty... shrill/harsh and ""sterile/lifeless"" and ""metallic"" if you will. My ears just got tired very quickly from listening to it, and it just sounded off and bad (especially certain Vocal Notes,  simply felt like my ears were being subject to nail on chalkboard torture), compared to the old stock radio that came with the jeep (only reason i replaced it was because it had no aux output).

I've noticed this recently aswell, with a lot of purchases of seemingly high quality audiophile equipment   (DAC'S/AMPS/Headphones) Having this sound signature, i've researched a bit and it seems to be the defining ""sound"" of digital audio to an extent...is this true? I've had digital audio sound amazing and not like this at all, but now that i think about it, analog has never had that lifeless/empty/shrill sound quality. What other factors are involved? I absolutely hate this ""sound signature"" and cannot enjoy music at all with it present. It feels like torture."

audiophile,"Not sure if this is the right sub but figured i‚Äôd give it a try anyways.

Given the popularity and variety of amplifying boxes/stands for improving smartphone sound quality and volume, I‚Äôm surprised at the apparent complete lack of similar ideas for improving Bluetooth speaker output.

What inspired my need/desire for something like this is work related outdoor use. There‚Äôs often no power source beyond USB battery packs, so Bluetooth speakers are ideal. I tend to prefer the cylinder shaped speakers, for general use, though I‚Äôve tried others as well. And overall the open space of outdoors seems to generally negatively impact sound quality and volume. And since accidents of all sorts happen, lower priced speakers are the better option.

Now I have a workshop and all the necessary skills for construction, what I lack is the required understanding of acoustics and sound projection to design something like this.

What I‚Äôm looking for is any help and/or tips in how to go about building a sound projection/amplification box/stand for cylinder type Bluetooth speakers. Shape, acoustic related features, preferred materials, etc... The basic idea is some kind of open faced projection box that you sit the speaker in.

The general goal/wish is to improve both bass and volume and also to project sound in a forward (V) direction. I‚Äôve experimented a bit and know this can definitely be done, but I lack any knowledge of passive audio improvement and acoustic projection that would save me time and effort. Online searches haven‚Äôt resulted in anything either.

If anyone can help, I‚Äôd be very grateful."
audiophile,Hi my IE800S wire have started to tear and I wanted to get them fixed. I recently heard about vesper audio and they are able to get then fixed. I want to know if they are trustable and I womt be sending them my earpiece and not get it back.
audiophile,"
yo guys I produce music and my biggest downfall are my ears, they're big, so i get really uncomfortable using headphones for a long time with almost every decent flat response pair of headphones, if they're comfortable they usually end up being shit.

I'm just looking for comfortable headphones with flat response, can handle heavy bass, and big ass ear pads for my massive head and ears.

I'm not familiar with headphone amps but I'm willing to learn how they work if they're worth it.

There's always a disadvantage with these common/ cheaper headphones like dt770 (not too uncomfortable but the Athm50x sound better) or Audio technica/ Athm50x (they sound good but are really tight and uncomfortable). They're both shit in my experience.

I tried some Akgs and they were the best for comfort, however, the head strap felt heavy on the top of my head with time, and the bass was not there, its like there's a high pass filter built in at around 200hz..

I'm open to any suggestions and I don't mind anything pricey either but I just wanna get what I paid for, I'm sick of buying new headphones every few months.

I need quality

I tried going to r/headphones and r/audioengineering but their rules are weird.

thanks"
audiophile,"I guess I should pad on my own back for the website I put together. You can find it here:  [https://www.theaudioboard.com/](https://www.theaudioboard.com/). Owning and using audio equipment has always been my joy and hobby since college time. That's some 40 years now. I used my spare time browsing eBay, Craigslist, and other places for amps, speakers, and stuff. If you are also doing this, you know a super deal could vanish in a blink of your eye. Over the years, I was lucky to score a few super deals, like $500 for a Marantz 7c (the tube one), $1000 for 7 pairs of nice Altec 605B with crossovers (church went on an ""upgrade""), $280 for Brook 12A plus 3c (plus a framed picture of them), etc. You would wish something out there that sends alerts once a good (does not need to be super great) deal surfaces somewhere. So I put together some Python scripts to do just that. It worked perfectly in the past few years. I am not a professional programmer, didn't know anything about PhP, HTML, or Python. If you are old enough, you might have heard of FORTRAN. Yeah, that's what I knew. Anyway, here we are, I embedded the Python in a website listed above. It is still under constant improvement; some of the features may not be as fast, or even smooth as you want. And many other features are yet to be implemented. However, we believe the current release provides a glimpse of the potentials this tool may enjoy more fully someday. Two important things you should do. (1) sign up an account, and (2) read ""How To"" page. I hope you find it useful."

audiophile,"As 2022 comes to an close, can we dispatch some of the cliches which pollute almost every post to some small degree? 

Let me explain:

You did not *""pull a trigger,""* rather, you opted to make a purchase in the marketplace.

The only *""endgame""* is that associated with the cessation of existence.

The perverse need for validation expressed by *""how did I do, guys?""*

The smug rhetorical expression of wealth expressed by *""how did I do, guys?""*

You do not *""join a club""* by making a purchase.

You didn't *""bite a bullet,""* rather you simply made a purchase that you both enjoyed contemplating making, and doling out the cash for.

And let us never forget the many variations on the theme of suggesting that one has no control over their buying habits, nor their love of headphones.

With a little creativity, and an online thesaurus, I hope many of you find a more meaningful set of words to convey your love of the hobby.

audiophile,"I considered myself an audiophile 30 years ago. Kids and work change everything. Got rid of my 3000+ LP collection and my 2000+ CD collection. Now I want a lossless streaming setup. Apparently I did not do enough research and bought an NAD streaming integrated amp which seems to weakly push my vintage ADS L710‚Äôs, which I still love. 

The idea was that I assumed, without properly vetting it, that the BluOS built in would stream Apple. It does not. I hate Tidal but even my tired old ears can hear a bit of difference between Apple Lossless and Spotify.

Will that just get better over time as I play more and more or is that something I have to constantly work on and won‚Äôt come naturally as I play more?

guitar,"Hey all,

Today, I purchased a [this](https://imgur.com/a/eXpu66s) beautiful Sunburst Stratocaster second hand. It is in top condition, hardly any visible scratches on the body, frets are 9/10 and paid ‚Ç¨700 for it, including a gig bag.

I checked its serial number (N6166889) found on the back of the headstock on the official Fender [site](https://serialnumberlookup.fender.com/lookup/).  The database spit out that this the guitar in question is an \`American Standard Stratocaster¬Æ, Maple Fingerboard, Black\`. There is one little hiccup here; mine is sunburst.

So I disassembled it and found the following suspicious:

* After removing a paper sticker, I found a date stamped on the neck that says \`Oct 21 1988\` (?).
* The neck pocket has another date stamp that says something like \`05 06 1996\`.
* There are black screws on the chrome bridge (it feels it is not the original ones)
* There are black tremolo springs (I can't imagine them being the original)
* The pickup cavity is one massive block craved out of the body (first time I see this)

I have the following questions to the community:

* Is there any way I could identify the guitar better?
* Is that normal to have a mismatch between the neck pocket date and the neck date?
* Could it be that the Fender database is wrong about the guitar being Black instead of Sunburst?
* Most importantly, do you think it is a Parts- or a genuine Stratocaster?

All input is appreciated! Many thanks."
guitar,"Hiya!

So I had a couple logistical questions about creating music covers for publishing on social media, and I'd really appreciate your insights on these ‚ù§Ô∏è

&amp;#x200B;

* For acoustic covers, if you're playing the guitar at the same time as singing, how do you tweak/control the sound levels of vocals and the instrument separately in the recording?
* Do you have any fav sound editing software you use for post-processing? I'd only be looking to do super minimalist stuff, like removing any background noise, maybeeee normalizing the track (any recommendations for such lowkey-minimalist editing processes is also appreciated!)
* Finally, how can you post covers, possibly monetizing them? I've heard about third-party platforms like Distrokid. What are some of your top platforms to go through? Can you ever go through without them?

&amp;#x200B;

Any other tips and suggestions are wholeheartedly welcome ‚ù§Ô∏è

This is just the way that I got it from the EverTune guys. I asked them if they were able to file the nut for my custom tuning/string gauge and they said they couldn‚Äôt so I have to assume that this is how it came from the Indonesian factory in which it was made. 

Would this cause intonation issues? The slots are far too deep and wide for my 10-56 Elixir set.

The sales ""Engineer"" was very nice but when it came to price, he offered me about 8% off on the guitar and fitted case. I could do better at Guitar Center and not even have to talk to anyone I thought to myself. I proposed the following. Kick in the fitted case for free.

I know the margin has to be better on a plastic and fabric case than the guitar. Brief pause, some typing, and he agreed. Got them to toss in the $220 RR6/7 fitted case for free, and if you wanna get nitpicky it lowered the tax due as well.

please excuse me if this is not the right sub or if I'm not using the correct tag. I don't know where to ask my question:

I'm playing guitar in a punk rock cover band. We mostly cover punk songs from the 80s or pop songs from the 90s. We change to songs a bit and add new elements or change parts of it due to our limited abilities ;)

My band members asked me if I could replace some of my solos (mostly based on pentatonic scale) with ""real"" melodies from other songs. Just to give you an example: My solo in our ""Hit me baby one more time"" cover is the main riff from SOADs ""Aerials"". In an other song I play the main riff from ""Seven Nation Army"". 

So I'm basically looking for popular riffs or melodies that I could misuse as solos for other songs.

Every time I try to google something I just find famous stuff that would not fit into our songs. Of course the intro riff from ""Come as you are"" is popular and well known but does not have the ""punch"" I'm looking for.

Do you folks have any suggestions? Suggestions where to find such riffs or where I could ask?

guitar," 

i'm not talking about calluses, I've had calluses for years. I can't seem to go a day without picking up the guitar, but that's been detrimental to me ever since my fingers started hurt like this a few weeks ago. specifically my ring finger on my fretting hand hurts from bending so much, especially since I do it a lot on acoustic (and who doesn't love a screaming bend on the electric??) I'm constantly practicing for gigs and just playing for fun for hours. It's scaring me a bit since this is my passion and it feels like it's running away from me because it hurts to play.

I'm posting this to see if anyone has run into the same issue, and if there are any solutions you've found other than playing less? I'm gonna get some lighter strings and stick to electric for a while. I really don't want to take a break but I feel that I may have to for a few weeks to let my fingers heal. It's just disappointing because I've made lots of progress in my playing in the past year, and I feel like I'm letting it slip by taking a break. What are your thoughts?"

Hey yall, I‚Äôm not sure if this is the best thread for this post but I‚Äôm definitely a guitar beginner so I suppose its about as good a place as any.

I‚Äôve got a whopping 25 hours of practice under my belt  ( I know thats not much) but I REALLY want this song to be the first I learn to play.

My biggest struggle is figuring out which fingers are fretting which strings.

If anyone could provide some sort of Chord box / diagram (for lack of a better word), whether image or text base, it would be tremendously helpful.

Any sources you could provide would also be an incredible help.
 
The key is C minor.
Theres four chords in the song - 
-The first is described as a ‚Äú Regular C Minor Chord‚Äù
-The second is described as a D minor chord with an A sharp
-The third a D sharp bar chord
-The final is a G major 

-You can also switch the song up a little with an A sharp major chord he shows in the video so that bit of information would be helpful as well.

I apologize for my ignorance, and I appreciate your patience.

Plz Help :-)"

The amp was set at 50 watts, if I recall correctly, with 50 volume, 50 master and probably something like 30 gain. Could I have damaged the amp by playing those couple of seconds at that volume?

Also, when I set it to clean I still get a really low volume background noise, is that normal?

Background: I've struggled to find a decent Electric Blues course that aligns with my skill level. I've tried a few times over the years to get into Blues playing but nearly every Blues course I've tried has been either boring, a style of Blues that I could care less for, or the course might say it's for intermediates but starts off at such a low level that I zone out. I even have a subscription to Jam Play and still couldn't find anything on there that kept my interest.

Not anymore! I found an excellent Blues course for those trying to play like the late greats of the 60's and 70's.

Here's the best part: It's offered for FREE on YouTube. Although you can pay for additionals like backing tracks, tabs, etc.

So if you were like me, struggling to find an effective and interesting Electric Blues course, this one is THE ONE.

Dan is a fantastic teacher who explains the theory behind everything and will teach you some cool licks to get you started. You can tell he's a Blues man through and through.

My Blues playing has SKYROCKETED in the last few weeks. Thanks DAN!

I‚Äôm looking into buying a new guitar to replace my squire.

I was thinking of getting a new fender am pro Stratocaster then saw some  vintage ones that looks much cooler and with cooler history. Sounds great too.

Weird question but does playing guitar over a long period of time change the wood structure on a micro level. More specifically, if sound waves reverberate creating like, micro grooves in the body/neck making for a better sound and tonal structure. 

I like the thought of getting a new one to create my own history and structure but also if it‚Äôs broken in,maybe it sounds much sweeter from the get and it won‚Äôt too long.

Any thoughts?"

I'm looking for a guitar with a warm, almost blues sound I think. I heard a Guild ""Westerly collection"" and loved it (they also have a certain cost).

My budget can go up to 350-400 euros. I don't want to start with a 100 euro entry level because I'm afraid of getting tired after a few months of use if the sound is then too anonymous or too squeaky.

I would like a medium body, for use at home and surely from my sofa. I don't need amplification, if it has it welcome but it's not very important to me.

For now my favourites that I have identified are:

* GUILD M-240E / GUILD OM-240E  (I found the first one for 400 euro)
* GRETSCH JIM DANDY (attracts me but I am not too convinced to go on a parlor)
* FENDER CC-60S / FENDER CD-60S (I include it because it was my starting point, but maybe it falls under the anonymous sound)

Surely there are many others that I have not yet considered.   
This is really a new field for me, thank you to those who will help me in my search."
guitar,"I'm looking into attenuators and found a 100w unit. My amp is rated 20w with 16 ohm out to a 16ohm 212. (Attentuator also has a 16 ohm jack)

I hear that the attenuators get real hot running a 100w amp. Does this also happen with a 20w amp? Like does it get just as hot, but it take longer to get there, or does it just not get as hot because its only working with 20w of its total 100w capabilities?"
guitar,"Anyone here try Godin Redline guitars? I‚Äôm curious how they stack up against ESP/LTD guitars. I like the extra jumbo frets on ESP/LTD along with their thin U neck design, so I‚Äôm wondering if the Redline is similar."

So I've been playing the same schecter omen 6 string for the past 10 years

I've never bought a guitar since then (I was 14 at the time) I'm now 24, with adult money, and I want to spoil myself.

My friends tell me to get a PRS, a stratocaster, or something single coil, but I almost never play anything with clean tones because it sounds muddy on my schecter. 

I'm always playing classic rock, progressive rock, and occasionally metal. 

I don't want a guitar that sounds muddy when it doesn't have as much distortion though

TLDR:  I want a versatile guitar that I'll use for rock/metal but I also don't want it to sound like shit with cleaner tones??"

I was looking to get a single coil humbucker for the strat, but now I‚Äôm a bit turned off, fearing the payoff will not be worth the price. 

I usually play stuff like Grunge/ Hard rock and metal/ using entirely the Ibanez. Could the strat get a closer sound to Grunge with that single change? Or should I wait a few more to get a better upgrade?"

guitar,"My dad passed away last year and for my entire life his electric guitar was sitting in its case down in a basement closet. I recently took a look at it and found out it's an Epiphone that is pretty darn old, I think maybe a model from the 1930s (looks like a Tudor). 

Unfortunately, now I think understand why it sat there. It's not in the best condition (cracked paint, cracks in the binding).

Does anyone know any good luthiers who handle really old vintage guitars?

Then i put this set on (no problems), and a couple days later the high E broke again. I checked my bridge bc it was kinda odd since i wasnt playing hard or anything. I saw nothing but cleaned it out anyway, and cleaned all the contact points and threw on a new set. Now 4 days later i broke another one, literally playing a scale normally. Never had this happen before. Anyone else experiencing this? Have they reduced in quality in the past couple years?"

I don't really want to take the pickguard off as l've read that if you have a floating bridge (which I do) removing all the strings can cause setup issues.

guitar,"I have a black and white washburn lyon electric guitar from the early 2000‚Äôs with the action set low. I have been playing guitar for approximately a decade. Recently, I have been putting significant wear and tear on it. I have been playing on it for hours nearly everyday for the last three years. I‚Äôve always had problems with the audio cutting in and out. It‚Äôs happening more now with using guitar plugins on Reaper (i.e. Neural DSP Archetype: Gojira). Recently, I‚Äôve had some problems with sustain. The guitar frets have been cleaned. The guitar has been restringed with brand new Ernie Ball 2255 Extra Slinky Classic Rock N Roll Electric Guitar Strings .008. As for the digital plugins, I am using a brand new audio interface and guitar cable. The sustain is normal now on most of the notes, especially the higher ones.

However, I am still not hearing sustain on the lowest notes (Low E string), especially with power chords. This is especially noticeable on the digital plugins. On the amp, sometimes I do get sustain on the lowest notes and sometimes I don‚Äôt. (More specifically, the note will ‚Äúring out‚Äù for one second and then die out. Whereas normally, it will sustain for five seconds or more.) The guitar is tuned to E standard and I had checked the tuning several times. I have used plugins for years and I never recall having this big of an issue with sustain. Moreover, power chords on the 1st and 2nd fret on the 2nd string (A) sound off both on the amp and on plugins. (Unless it‚Äôs my imagination, because I‚Äôve been going through a lot with this guitar lately!) I am having difficulty doing sliding riffs, especially if two consecutive power chords should be audible from just the sustain alone. In distortion mode, I notice no audible differences with the tone knobs. However, in clean mode I can notice some minor audible differences with the tone knobs.

I am thinking the pick ups need to be replaced. However, I am in need of more opinions and insights to get a better idea of what is going on. I want to know if it could be something other than the pickups that could be causing these problems. If I need to go to a luthier, I want to make sure I know how to explain all the issues in a way that makes sense. Thank you so much!

(It is especially important to get sustain on the plugins, because I want to record digitally again. I had no problems with these plugins before.)

guitar,"Recently I started back playing after a few years of not bothering much. I've become obsessed once again, so I fancy a new guitar to spice things up a bit. I'm currently playing a Jackson Kelly KEXMG (I bought it in 2015 and it's had a hard life) and I have a Fender Telecaster HH Custom (2015). The Jackson is my guitar of choice, looks cool and just prefer how it plays. But the fit &amp; finish and quality of it aren't great (paint cracking etc.). 

So, I'm not really sure what the big hitters are seeing as I haven't shopped since 2015. I'm open to buying used. I do want a KE2 Kelly, but for around ¬£3500 (used!) you really are paying for it. That could get me an SG Standard, LP Standard and a newer X series Kelly. All 3 for that price. Which offers a lot of diversity. Also I'm not sure if a KE2 would be easy to re-sell if I should ever want to, whereas Gibson is really popular. But the KE2 is what I would prefer if I got to pick one guitar only. But I don't have to pick only one.  

I like SG standards, but I've owned one before but they are a touch plain in terms of spec (I like a Floyd Rose). Love the look of LP standards, but was never a fan of the bulky neck and thick set neck, I found them awkward to play. But maybe it could offer something new (I guess it's probably similar to my Tele though..)

I mostly play rock/metal. I don't really want something ultra metal orientated, I currently play EMG 81/85 but I prefer passive, I find the EMGs are too metal orientated (heavy) sometimes. Honestly, the KE2 is the one I want but I just don't think you can justify the price considering you are essentially paying for a very high standard of finish! 

So, any ideas?

Thanks guys!"
guitar,"Fixing fx loop with buffer doesn't work

I use the fx loop of a Marshall Origin 50 for my Reverb and Delay, but it somehow scrambles my tone. As this is a fairly common issue, I found out quickly that I may need a buffer. I tried using TC Electronics' Polytune 3 Mini, because I have one and it has a buffer built in and I tried it in every possible way imaginable. In front of the pedals, behind them, in between, I tried taking some away, but I always get the same result. I get the feeling that the problem is somewhere else in the fx loop.

The Pedals I use in the loop are a Behringer VD400 Delay, an EHX Canyon and a Strymon BlueSky.

Any Ideas?"
guitar,"I even play in alternate tunings. I have no idea what Im doing. Right now, I really like DADGCE. I know Don Ross used it so I decided to try it. I dont know jack about reading or writing music- I took bass lessons for like 6 months when I was a kid. Just enough to be able to play. I could play by ear though, my hands just sort of when to the right place and it was really easy to figure out songs once I knew different techniques and got my timing down. I played in lots of bands and never really saw a point to learn theory. I dont really like covering other bands. I make up my own music. People tell me its good. 

What am I doing then if I dont know anything? I guess what Id say I was doing is ""making up chords"" and improvising. Meaning, I just try different shapes until something sounds cool, or ""right"", then I make up or find another one that sounds like itd be the next logical/good sound. I normally will do that 4 times or more depending on the drums and bam thats the formula for how lots of other songs sound. 4 chords in a specific order, to a beat. Maybe youll have a change thatll be your bridge. Then I will try strumming those chords, picking them in different ways, etc. Sometimes Ill have a drumbeat looped and just mess around trying to ""find"" new chords and arrange them into something that could be looped over the beat and lyrics written over or a solo. Then start jamming/improvising/bullshitting/letting natural flow come out of you and thru your instrument without even thinking about it- I just improvise solos. I figure out by just noodling all over the place with my new loop of found chords that I arranged and just kinda figure out which notes I can hit and which ones I shouldnt. After awhile of doing that a million times it becomes second nature where I can go or not and I dont even have to think about it, its almost muscle memory. All by memory and ear and feel. I can also imagine or hear in my head something Id want to do and pretty easily be able to figure it out without much effort. 

Im totally self taught on guitar, only ever had those 6 months of bass lessons which I dont remember much of at all. I play 4 and 6 string basses, 6 7 and 8 string guitars, both acoustic and electric. I play fingerstyle and percussive style. Slap bass and everything. I taught myself how to play with all 8 fingers and thumb. I just like all kinds of music and sort of absorb it. It comes out in what I play. Every once in awhile Ill try to figure out a song someone else did, and finding something else that sounds cool and just building on that instead of learning their song haha. 

So, what am I doing? Ive played for people that knew chord names and they were like oh, you just played a major 5th or something and Im like oh, cool. I have no idea what you just said. But they also said damn, youre pretty good. So idk. I kinda think I should learn theory and see if I will be blown away or not by it.

guitar,"Hi, 

I want to buy a Majesty Guitar. There are a multitude of considerations that flow into the decision what kind of guitar to buy. Two of them would be looks and specs. And I'm quite confused by the variances of the Majesties. I'm interested in 6-strings.

The newest ones (July 22) are the dark ones with only the neck through part colored. Which I find not thaaaat nice. I really like the enchanted forest one, which was released in 2019. Now my question is, how different are these options spec-wise? From what I can read online, they do not seem to differ. But is it correct to assume that the only differences in the recent releases are the finishes? (And maybe sometimes the wood.) 

Bonus questions:

1) Do you think there will be a new line in the close future? If yes, when?

2) There are also the JP15 or so by Music Man. He never plays them, but they are also quite expensive. What's the deal with them? I understand the sterlings, but another high end product that doesn't get nearly the same attention as the majesty doesn't make a lot of sense, i think.

I'm looking forward to your replies! 

Cheers."
guitar,"In Spirit Love's intro the guitar sounds a bit like a sitar.  [Slash - Spirit Love (feat. Myles Kennedy and The Conspirators) \[Art Track\] - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ViNhsjX-8Q&amp;ab_channel=Slash) 

That's something I'd like to reproduce for one of my own tracks, but I can't really figure out how this is done. It sounds a bit like a wah-wah with some resonant frequencies. 

Does anyone have a clue about this ?

guitar,"Hello guys,

I played the guitar before 8 years, metal mostly, then I completely gave up as I was kinda bored to play everything again and again as I was purely looking at tabs. I have some basic knowledge of some notes on the guitar and C major scale (wow). I never played anything crazy fast though, as copying solos one-to-one and practicing it for 1 week was not really my thing.

Anyway, as I have kind of picked up the guitar again I would like now to combine it with some music theory, and head towards improvisation, learn some licks and adapt them to various scales, learn some arpeggios and general stuff, not just grind metal solos by tabs.

Any idea on where to start, as I am not a total beginner on guitar, but also I am a total beginner on theory? :P"
guitar," I bought an Ibanez XH300 in December 2021 and am very happy with it! Although not the most expensive guitar, it is my favorite guitar, purely for its shape ([picture of my guitar here](https://preview.redd.it/el7nkeq6xy891.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a578dad86e05da30db454c6a43a88473e1b2d08f))

When I bought the guitar in a pawn shop I did not see that it was somewhat yellowed, and the other day when I took the bridge off when changing the strings I saw the original color under the bridge (a white spot so to speak). Then I started thinking if I liked the fact that the guitar is not ""all white"" or if I just thought this was cool. I like a bit of that worn look myself. The guitar has no scratches or dents, it's just a bit yellowed. I assume the previous owner smoked and that caused the yellowing.

Some people say it looks really cool and shows the history of the guitar and they consider the yellowing a ""battle scar"" so to speak. And some people I've shown the guitar to say they like it better in white and that this look is not so great. So I hesitate.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why I wanted to ask the question within the community. Would you mind if your white guitar yellowed? And why?"

guitar,"The last time I properly played guitar was around 2015/2016, since then I've not really had either the interest or room to do so. I've recently moved into a new place and do have the space, and more importantly, don't have any direct neighbours. I used to have a Line 6 Spider IV amp which I bought when I first started out (including the pedal to switch between the different channels), but it's time to move on to something a bit more serious. 

I mostly play metal, but like my occasional clean stuff as well so a way of switching between them would be nice. The amp is for home use only so it doesn't have to be the loudest thing. I genuinely have no idea what the going rates of amps are at this point, so give me any suggestion and I'll device whether it's a feasible option or not :D

As I also mentioned, I've got an Epiphone Explorer, but since I don't really play at the moment, I keep it in a case. I would like to keep it next to my amp though when I'm not playing, preferably on a stand with space for more than one guitar. Due to its odd shape I'm not quite sure if I can buy any stand, any thoughts/ideas?"

guitar,"Couple of questions for you bright minded people out there: 

So I have a voice range of C3 - F4 and so (please correct me if I'm wrong) I figure that my comfortable singing voice is going to be the pitch of my talking voice but up a note or two (this as the voice goes up a tad when singing) so this meaning I sing comfortably around E3 . 

With this said (if correct?) when making a guitar instrumental melody/or choosing the correct key (through the use of a capo) for an instrumental melody would it be best that the middle note (median) of the range of the instrumental melody be best near/or around the same as my comfortable singing voice (E3) note, This way my vocal range and the instrumental range exist together within a simular octave of which I guess helps, I guess secondarily I'm trying to understand if this is the theory behind why a singer may need to change the key of a song to suit his/or her voice."

I think the tricky thing with recording music is the big sense of imposter syndrome that you can get. Like when I was recording guitar parts, during like the first few drafts, I was able to play the guitar part as a bit of a triplet, which kind of made it sound more, I guess, technical. But this time around, I decided that instead of doing that, I'll just play it kind of more normally."

guitar,"I am learning more and more songs in Aeolian so I am looking for advice on how to build better solos over changes with more minor chords. With major/mixolydian changes, I mostly focus on the b3&gt;3 to outline the chords. Or chromatic 3 to 5. With dorian, using the 6 to b7 bend produces the characteristic sound. I think the b6 is the characteristic tone of Aeolian but there is no simple answer like bend the b6 to produce Aeolian.

Looking online, the main advice is to use the minor pentatonic and add the b6 and 9. That's fine, but I am looking to go beyond that. I transformed my playing over major changes by focusing on outlining the chords, especially with the b3&gt;3 in mind. You could say about major changes: focus on the major pentatonic and add the b3, but that doesn't capture the core of it. Is there a minor equivalent to the b3&gt;3 move to make the change on a major chord?

Let's say I'm looking at Am to Dm, play Am pentatonic with the 9 over the Am add the b6/b3 of Dm over the Dm. Add the blue note (Eb). At high tension points, use the harmonic minor aka raise the 7th to sound metal. 

Is there a more advanced approach I can take to improvising - beyond augmenting the pentatonics and aeolian scale runs? How can I ""make"" changes of just minor chords?"

The two guitars I'm looking at specifically is the Fender Player Jaguar - Pau Ferro Fingerboard, and the Fender Mustang - Maple Fingerboard.

I enjoy how they both sound but I give the slightest edge to the Jaguar however, I've done some research and I've heard that the Jag has some issues with the bridge/saddles. I'm unsure if the Mustang has the same issues.

I am also completely open to other short scale guitars that are more lightweight. 

As far as I'm aware, the jag is the higher end model, but both guitars are around the same price. If I were to get the Jag, should I spend more on a higher end version?"

I live in the US and wasn't surprised that I hadn't heard about this until now since I wasn't particularly interested in guitars or Korean labor disputes in the past, but it got me wondering if something similar has ever happened at other big-name companies? I did some cursory research, but couldn't find anything, but I can't imagine this was the only time; especially because a lot of guitars are manufactured in factories in countries that don't have particularly strong worker's rights, not that the US is a haven of laborer protection or anything.

My question mainly comes from wanting to buy a guitar from a company / built in a place that didn't encourage workers to set themselves on fire in protest."

Would you recommend one of these amp models? If so which one?"

guitar,"My only electric guitar since 2014 is a Mexican Stratocaster, and now, after a decade of playing, I'm looking to make an upgrade. I've been having some issues with it (frequently out of tune, buzzing frets, low volume on the e string on the neck pickup), which 2 luthiers couldn't fix already, so I'm either going to upgrade a few parts or sell it and buy a PRS Silver Sky SE.

I've watched tons of reviews on the Silver Sky and actually tried one out, and I love it. The balanced bridge pickup is amazing and the lighter weight is a huge plus for me since I'm a short guy. I just don't know if it's worth it to sell my current strat and buy the PRS, or if I should just upgrade it (despite the issues that I mentioned, it's a great guitar). I also wanted to know if the parts on the Silver Sky SE are actually better than the ones on the Mexican Strat or if I would have to upgrade them too once I bought it. Any thoughts?

NOTE: A 3rd option would be to buy an American Strat, although it's a bit above my budget... but please leave your thoughts on that too!"
guitar,I feel like a bit of a poseur when I consider paying a lot of money for something with fake wear.  I also worry that it's a fad like Levi's with holes in the knees which will be mocked at some future date and they'll be impossible to resell. Thoughts?
guitar,"Hello everyone, I have an electric guitar with two ceramic single coil pickups (the ones that came with the guitar) and a coil-splitted Seymour Duncan SH-4 in the bridge. I was looking into changing the two single coils with some AlNiCo ones because after listening to some comparisons on YouTube I decided that I liked the sound better. What are some single coils that could sound great with that SH-4?  
Thanks!

guitar,"Let's get the discussion going - what makes it the most difficult one and how do you practice it? I like slower and easier songs as well and approve good harmony, melody and chord progression. I'm not super technical but I do like to practice it and challenge myself!

I have to use tabs for this one because I haven't trained my ear well enough for this kind of stuff and the piece is so long that I forget some parts again and again. So frustrating!"

guitar,"I have had a fander Jaguar for about 6 months and in that time the high E string has snapped 4 times at the bridge. It's happens once from when the guitar was brand new and freshly restringed by an expert and 3 times when I have restringed it.

guitar,"I posted about this [a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/10hlipa), and I finally got to the point where I had enough and decided to pay a professional. tl;dr a new switch I installed would work flawlessly when the pickguard was flipped over, but once it was installed and screwed down the pickups were either quiet or completely shorting out 

After it was ""done"" the first time the guy called me in pick it up, and we plugged it in, but now instead of the humbucker having problems it was the neck single coil. He said it was working last time he tested it, apologized and said he'd redo it.

Yesterday he calls me to come pick it up again, but this time he's busy and about to close so we don't test it in store. He swears it's working now, and he redid all the wiring and replaced the bridging wire. So I thank him, pay him, and go home to test it. Except when I do it's the exact same problem.

I feel kinda bad bringing it back to him, he only charged me $40 and he's spent a lot of time on it. But at the same time It's almost worse than when I brought it to him.

I was hoping maybe someone would have some ideas or alternative solutions - I suspect that somehow the switch is touching the bottom of the cavity and shorting out, but the switch is the exact same size and shape as the factory switch. It's also a brand new fender 5 way switch, and it works fine until the pickguard is installed."

guitar,"So I've been using a Hondo Formula 1 Randy Rhoads copy for about 2 years now and I've barely had any problems tuning it. I replaced the block and springs when I first got it because the old tremolo arm stripped the block, I always lube the nut (it has a nut with the locking system behind it) when changing the strings and I use D'Aaddario NYXL strings every time. I fully abuse the hell out of the whammy and it always returns to pitch. However in the last 2 months, whenever I use the whammy it stays flat when I depress it and it stays sharp when I pull up. In addition, and problem what is the culprit, is that it squeaks really loud when I use the tremolo and I can hear it from the bridge itself. I got it set up fairly recently but it developed this problem 2 weeks to a month later. The only thing I tried that made sense to help was replace the plates on the locking mechanism and the same issue kept happening."

I'm pretty used to strats, Les Pauls and acoustics or acoustic-electrics, I don't really play Gretsch that much.

I've learned the basic Pentatonic Shape in G minor (the one we all know!), and have learned the basic movable shapes for G7, C7 and D7. The Blues You Can Use book by John Ganapes has been really useful so far. 

I'm just trying to get into to target tones. Specifically I'm trying to get into trying to land on a chord tone that is a half-step away from a chord tone of the following chord as, to my ear, this sounds really smooth and slick, but I feel a bit lost and overwhelmed with the number of options. 

For example over the G you could land on the B note (3rd) and slide this down a half-step to Bb which is the b7 of the C7 chord. 

I feel all you Blues-Heads out there must have some advice/books/website/songs, so I wonder if any of you could share some advice on how to improve this specific style of playing. 

I've started studying Stevie Ray Vaughn Lead Guitar style, unsure if this is wise?

guitar,"Hi everyone

So I currently own a Squier Bullet Strat and a 15W Vault Modelling amp as my gear that I used to basically only do some bedroom practice, I don't really plan on going out to play live or anything as of now maybe in a small college band sometime in the future. I only recently started electric (around 2 -3 months), but I was an acoustic player for a few yrs on and off prior to that.

I'm looking for an upgrade within the $350 mark. And I can't really seem to decide if I should upgrade my guitar first, or get a better amp. Not really in a rush or anything since I'm only gonna start saving up now.

My thought process right now is, ""well the guitar I have is mostly fine except 1 problem, that is I seem to have a slightly flat 9th fret so whenever I play the g string on that fret (only) I have a bit of buzzing.... it's annoying but I can live with it for now probably. On the other hand I only really have a few usable tones from my amp, one of them being a full clean tone, a slightly overdriven/tubescreamer-y sound and a heavy distortion full metal sound."" Have no pedals at all, obviously doesn't make sense to have any with this amp I think, maybe a looper sometime in the future.

So I am currently leaning towards buying a new amp, particularly the Boss Katana 50 Mk2 because it just seems like a no brainer, sounds good, has all the features I need, fits in the budget and it'll probably be the ""last"" amp I will ever **NEED** as per my requirements. But at the same time I'm thinking, maybe an all round better guitar like maybe the squier affinity would mean I have my hands on a way better feeling instrument (or so I hope?). But then again, I'll probably want to go upgrade to a Classic vibe or something later on anyway since I feel like that's probably where its the most bang for buck.

I could link a recording of my amp/guitar buzz thing if needed but I don't think I need to right now so lmk if I should.

TLDR; Need to decide between guitar/amp... Guitar is mostly fine except a flat fret/fret buzz issue on the 9th fret... amp gets really bad when I turn it up loud and not much tones to choose from"

First of all, thank you all for your help.
I'm a super newbie to guitar (it's my purpose for this year üòÅ). I inherited an electric guitar (a very basic squier) and was thinking now about getting an acoustic guitar that I could use for travelling as well, so looking for guitars on the smaller side.
Since I just started, I would like to keep it cheap but I understand getting a decent instrument is a good idea, so I wanted to ask for advice on the next options to see what would everyone recommend:

Yamaha FG-Junior - can get it second hand for about 100‚Ç¨, with its original sleeve and all.

Harley Benton GS-Travel: brand new from shop at 109‚Ç¨, free shipping, B-Stock also available at 99‚Ç¨

Harley Benton GS-Travel-E: amplified versi√≥n, B-Stock, available at 117‚Ç¨, free shipping. Not sure how much worth is it to get amplified 

Yamaha FG800: second hand guitar, 155‚Ç¨ + shipping (about 175‚Ç¨ total, not considering it does not have a sleeve). Almost double the price and I believe it's full size, but I have seen it recommended many times so just wondering if it's so worth it that I maybe should stretch.

I am open to any other suggestions, of course :) 

Thanks a lot again!"
guitar,"I bought an edwards pink sawtooth and every amp that I plug it into in my apartment makes it play the radio.

Time on My Hands is a popular song with music by Vincent Youmans and lyrics by Harold Adamson and Mack Gordon, published in 1930 and introduced in the musical Smiles. The song has been covered by many of the great artists in the jazz universe such as Billie Holiday, Glen Miller, Chet Baker or Keith Jarrett among many others. This version of Django was one of the first to be made, in 1939, where it impregnated the entire sound of Django in a standard that will sound for many years to come.

Sure, it will never have nitro finish checking...however, if I ever wanted to try to lacquer my own guitar, it would definitely be this one, i'd try chipping off the poly and then i can have real lacquer checking if i so choose.

guitar,"So recently I intonated my guitar and everything is perfect except for the G string, (or f string for d standard). The problem is, when playing within the first 5 or so frets the note will be considerably sharp even when the open string is tuned correctly. And strangely, as you move higher up the fretboard on the G it will start to vary wildly, some frets being flat, some being fine, and others being sharp. There is a good couple frets that have fine intonation but it sticks out like a sore thumb when playing the bad ones, especially in chords you just can't not notice it. This happens specifically to my G string and no other one. Also side note, when playing the 12th fret on the G string the note dies out pretty quickly compared to the other strings, i'd say the sustain is chopped right in half with the note ending abruptly. So I would appreciate if anyone has any opinions on how I could approach this to fix it so that the intonation will be at least consistent for the G. Also I will link a video below demonstrating the problem (me playing every note on the G string starting on open), also worth noting that in the video I am applying very little pressure to the frets to try to get it as accurate as possible. Any help would be appreciated thank you.

But I when it comes to some of the ""shred"" elements if you like, my playing is found wanting.

You are looking at my PRS C24 10-top Wood Library blah blah blah guitar. Its absolutely beautiful, But thats where my compliments stop. MSRP was $4650 at the time of purchase in early May 2022. This guitar hasnt been played over 20 hours since then, Ive been very busy with work, and when I have time, favor my LPs. I re-strung it once upon purchase, and its had those strings until this month. This month, I decided to take it in to a shop to have it plekd and the action lowered a bit. This is where it gets shifty. 

The shop tells me the guitar‚Äôs action really cant be lowered because the nut was cut too low from the factory, and to counter this they put .012‚Äù of relief in the neck to counter this. I may not be a luthier but that sounds like way too much relief. Anyways. 

I decide to get in contact with PRS, to see if they will honor their product/workmanship, and was told ‚Äúsorry, that isnt covered. You likely used the trem bar too much and that cut the strings into the nut.‚Äù The fact, though, is that Ive left the trem in its case anytime this guitar has been played. Also, remember how low the play time/usage is on this guitar. 

Lets move on to construction. Look at the photo in my post of the back of the headstock. Near the two ‚ÄúE‚Äù tuning keys (the two lowest), you will see small wooden ‚Äúwings‚Äù have been added to make the headstock profile wider, and assumedly to cut costs on necks. This seems very cheap when you can get a Squier with a one-piece neck. 

Look into the open cavities into the electronics. Notice the distinct lack of any shielding. The guitar is insanely susceptible to EMI. Moreso than my vintage reissue Gibsons (lets not start the Gibson talk, I know they have their issues, too). 

With the relief reduced AT ALL, the ‚Äúhigh e‚Äù thru the ‚ÄúD‚Äù strings all buzz at the first fret. I got a second opinion, and that shop told me without a new nut, the high action is here to stay. 

I am beyond upset with the guitar. I am beyond upset with PRS‚Äôs customer service and quality. I feel like I wasted years lusting after a PRS, and thousands buying one. I will NEVER buy one of their products again. If you want a good read on why PRS hate exists, here it is. Im so done im ready to turn this guitar into a fucking clock.

Basically a dream guitar for me, got this one used on reverb but it‚Äôs basically brand new. Bought it in a bit of a whim, but the Canadian dollar is not doing great so the hefty discount was hard to pass on, haha.

So far it‚Äôs amazing, I can‚Äôt believe how light it is and the chambered body is SO resonant‚Ä¶ you really feel those low strings deep in your body! The fluence modern pickups are also great, very unique and the high gain tones are rich and clear. Still working on my clean tones, as the others I‚Äôve dialed in have been based on very different pickups - but even then they still sound great, with a sort of percussive feel. I usually struggle to get along with bridge humbucker clean tones, but these have a bit more roundness (maybe?) that works well too.

I also didn‚Äôt find the endurneck hard to get used to, picked it up and it immediately felt good (admittedly a little thicker than used too but that‚Äôs not a downside). Overall a beautiful instrument that I‚Äôm aching to back to from work!"

guitar," Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone is familiar with EBMM guitars, I had a couple questions specifically about the Music Man JP6.

I'm currently looking at a few used JP6's in the Mystic Dream finish, like the one pictured [here](https://static.mercdn.net/item/detail/orig/photos/m56955627716_1.jpg?1650171927). It's listed as: MUSIC MAN JP6 MD RM TPZ

What do RM and TPZ mean? 

I assume that ""MD"" stands for Mystic Dream and *maybe(?)* TPZ is something to do with the piezo output? 

No idea what RM means though. Roasted Maple? I thought these came long before the roasted maple craze. Moreover, it doesn't look at all like roasted maple but I could be wrong.

Also, for anyone who's played or owned this guitar, how does the neck joint / heel feel? It looks kinda chunkier and further down the neck than I initially thought, even though the cutaway exposes the 24th fret.

And finally, does anyone have experience with EBMM when it comes to customer service or replacement parts? One of the JP's I'm looking at is from Japan and the awkward google translation mentioned it's being sold cheap as there might be an issue with the bridge.

I need some assistance with some amp suggestions. I am currently stuck between two different amp heads that I‚Äôm really torn on.

I am looking into getting a mini amp head, either the Peavy 6505MH or the PRS MT 15. I currently use a peavy Vypyr in my basement, and a Orange micro dark in my office for practice. I want to replace the Vypyr and get a proper tube amp. I only play at home, and I‚Äôm not in a band or plan to be in one, so I don‚Äôt need anything larger than 40 watts. 

I play mostly metal but span the different genres. So I will play modern metal, 2000s metal core, 80s hair metal, etc. I also play some rock as well. So my tunings range anywhere between E standard to Drop A.

I currently have an epiphone les paul that I don't like the sound of

Guitars I want

* A gibson les paul. It's out of my price range (of 1.5k max) but I can just wait a few more months and get it. But then les pauls aren't really versatile so I would kinda be stuck with one les paul that sucks and one really good les paul but nothing else. Also I'm afraid of the gibson quality control since I'll be buying online (have to buy online, they sell it for double the price in my country). And I don't love the sound of my current les paul, so what if I don't like the sound of this one?
* A tele (since it's a more powerful strat? + they say it's really versatile) but people describe it as ""twangy"", which is a no no for me, but I love the sound of Keith Richards and some punk bands I like play teles.
* A strat, a lot of people I like play strats, but people describe them as thin, I don't know why, when I listen to jimi hendrix or srv, they sound really thick and full. I also want to play heavier stuff (not metal), so idk if single coils will do me good. Also I love the sound of its neck pickup

But a les paul is by far the guitar that excites me most, when I look at one, I just melt.

I can't go and try these guitars, they cost about 10 times the minimum wage (in the case of a les paul), so they won't let me play them, plus the nearest guitar store that probably has these is about 4-5 hours of public commute away.

I mainly don't like modern guitars (ibanez, prs, etc.)"

guitar,"I set up my new american pro ii strat for the first time yesterday and swapped out the string gauge from the factory 9's to my usual 10's.

From all the guides I checked it started with a tremolo adjustment. I did that and tightened my tremolo a bit so that the max bottom position of the tremolo (close to the body) resulted in a 3 fret bend on the G string, 2 step bend on the B string and a 1 fret bend on the E string,

I then adjusted the truss rod and then the individual string action.

When I finished everything I checked the tremolo again and the bends were now slightly higher than before (around 2.5 frets on the B string).

I adjusted it again so that it was perfect as before, I then rechecked the string action and made some minor adjustments, when I checked the tremolo again it was again not like it was before.

Should I not worry about it? How important is the tremolo setup in the overall process?  
Is there a rule of thumb? should I put the action slightly higher than I want and then lower it by lowering the tremolo?"

To me it looks like he's assigned two fingers i.e., index and middle finger to do the light touching while using his thumb and ring finger to pick. But it sounds like there's something more going on."

I got a question (sorry if it might seem dumb. I'm still a beginner) that had left me very confused for long and couldn't seem to find an answer for so hopefully someone clarify it in an easy way. So I'm learning/practicing major scales right now. So when a major scale is played‚Äö you obviously need to play all of its 7 notes in order with the 'WWHWWWH' rule. So if this is the case then how do songs sound different when they are played in the same major scale? For instance‚Äö if I'm playing a song in a G major scale that has G A B C D E F# G as the notes of this scale. And someone else is also playing another song in a G major scale. The question here is that...how would both of our songs sound different if we are playing those 7 notes in order over and over? How would we sound different if we are playing in the same scale? Or am I getting it wrong? Like can I play the notes in a major scale but **not in order** and/or with some notes not played/repeated? And if I do so‚Äö would I still be playing in that specific major scale? For instance if I'm playing in a G major scale then I start to play G A D E C B G...then would that still be considered playing in a G major scale‚Äö taking in consideration that in this example I didn't play the notes in order as well as not playing all the notes included in the G major scale? Sorry for the long question but I would really appreciate if someone clears this confusion for me.
Thank you!"
guitar,"So I'm just going to come out and say it. I really want a shredding guitar. I'm by no means good. I can play a bunch of song intros, an AC DC, and Def Leppard song minus the solos I'm trying to get down as well as like 7 fingerstyle songs (My fingerstyle is intermediate level). My guitars consist of a high end graduation gift (S style by the big F) and a LP tribute I bought last year with my money. To be completely honest when choosing my graduation guitar I was kinda flustered. I wanted a specific guitar that was discontinued but the old man is more traditional (Jaguar with humbuckers).I also was interested in an HSS but you know strats should only be single coils. So me being 16 and confused as to not having support I ended up going with the strat. Its nice. Best neck I've ever felt. But I yearned for humbuckers so in a desperate attempt to balance it out I decided a year later to get a Les Paul. I play the Les Paul 98% of the time, I've had it for almost a year(One of my proudest decisions ever). However I want to do cool stuff with a Floyd rose. I feel like I made huge mistakes. Obviously I'm expected to keep the strat for ""sentimental value "". I could have saved all this money and time by just getting an RG or something. I know ""tone is in the fingers"" but damn I want to shred. At the time of picking my strat out I was new to guitar words and stuff despite playing a little, years before. So yeah should I just be the bigger man and buy whatever I want? I have a couple months until I start working so no money yet. I'll probably be better by then.I also screwed up starting my pedalboard by not researching enough and not getting what I really like at first. What mistakes have you made? Or perceived mistakes. Thanks, I love ya. Cheers."
guitar,"Hey, guitarists

Recently found this song that I really like by Model/Actriz, that has some glitchy, noisy guitar parts. The guitar comes in at 3:46, it has such a cool cut off effect and an unusual pattern. Tried to replicate it with my Multi-FX processor and with the volume knob, but I wasn't getting anywhere close.

Anyways, what would you guys suggest to do to get that similar sound? I know it's probably chopped up in a DAW, but still I can't let go of the thought that a person can replicate it live with only a guitar and pedals."

I have this year started to learn bluegrass guitar and what is referred to as ‚Äúcrosspicking.‚Äù 

I have hit a wall in my playing and have not been able to increase my speed from where it is right now for about a month. I understand that this is likely very common. 

Here are two examples of my playing:

https://youtu.be/mpoPO7207Mc

There are others on my channel but they are not relegated to flatpicking.

My current method of practice has been to try and play as fast as I can to a metronome, disregarding accuracy for now. I have tried to slowly increase the bpm with time but now my progress has stopped.

Let me know if there is anything that looks obviously wrong! Right now, I feel a lot of tension and am having trouble increasing my speed beyond these examples. Advice from any experienced bluegrass players would be much appreciated!"

guitar,"I have a used Breedlove. After 1 year of use. The frets were buzzing really bad, truss rod was really really loose. I couldn't find the Allen wrench. I got an allen wrench, adjust some truss myself. Broke a couple strings. Took a guitar to a popular guitar technician in the city. He put on extra light gauge stings and did some horrible setups. The frets continued to buzz. I took in the guitar again. He then shimmed the saddle, put on some Rope/Nylon strings and adjusted the truss again for pressure. Worked fine in his shop. Paid him $180 and left.

The F12th and 13th frets are still buzzing on E and A strings. Rest is good. I used to find the technician decent, but apparently, he made some sexually suggestive comments to me. I'm not going back. $180 wasted and lesson learned. It's pretty hard to spend in this economy but I had some performances coming up. I'm hoping to practice now. And take the guitar to another Luthier for a checkup before my performance in mid March/April.

My question is, is the saddle adjustment reversible? and the Truss adjustment reversible? I'm pretty angry at myself that I could've bought Light gauge strings, some finger picks myself online, and an Allen wrench myself and would've saved $150."

guitar,"
Need some help, basically been on about a three year plateau at a reasonably low level and I can't seem to find a way to solve it. For context I've been playing guitar since I was about 8 but only through some basic school lessons and properly picked up the instrument at the beginning of high school, from there I took part in a couple performances and briefly had a small band of friends that would jam occasionally. My peak of skill/practice was around two years ago when I was doing my music exams and I could probably manage a range of music that most 'outsiders' would consider impressive but really isn't all that challenging, let's say foofighters and music like that with relatively repetitive riffs and no solos. 

Today I still haven't progressed, around three years later and honestly have a strained relationship with music. I love the idea of guitar as well as bass, but I honestly just pick them up for about a minute a day, knock out the same old riff, get bored and put it down. And that comment is where I know a lot of people would just say 'well obviously you don't care, or that I should practice more' but I just can't find the passion anymore. In the summer I pushed myself to practice daily with an end goal of playing at least the riff parts of master of puppets by Christmas, I started to learn the song slowly, as well as building up through a selection of songs that would gradually improve my playing to that level. Despite putting in around an hour a day for about 6 months I've still not progressed even into those intermediate songs.

It's just disheartening, especially when my only music playing friend is some kinda wizard, genuinely of the same capabilities of many of the guitar gods, he just picks stuff up instantly and seems to have no physical limitations.

I don't know if this is any use but my problems are:

Genuinely can't understand music theory, even with professional teachers, it just escapes me even though I'm generally pretty smart in most things.

If I'm honest I feel completely useless in comparison to my friend who means well but obviously doesn't give a toss about what I've learnt or anything

No actual reason to practice/ no real goals to reach other than self imposed ones

I find myself struggling physically, for example not being able to coordinate alternate picking well and my fingers physically not being able to move fast or accurately even in basic scenarios

So basically what I'm wondering is if this is a normal thing to experience or am I almost 'too far gone'. Part of me just wants to step away from being a 'guitarist' and focus more on singing and playing so that I can at least brand myself with something I can manage more generally rather than trying to perfect something I seem to find impossible."

2) Can you guess how old it is ?

2) I want to make it playable again. What can  i do about that crack? Can i just glue it together with woodglue ? The space between the strings and the fretboard is a little big, especially in the higher frets. Is there a way to change that? (the saddle is not removable)

guitar,"Hi r/Guitar, I am a complete beginner on guitar and this is my first post here, so apologies if this is a really ignorant question!

I bought this budget guitar setup several years ago with the intent of using it to learn electric guitar and eventually be able to play along to some of my favorite metal songs. The gear is an Ibanez Gio (GRG121DX) and an Orange Micro Dark amp with an Orange PPC108 8"" cab. It has pretty much sat in a corner since then, until a few weeks ago when I finally started to make an effort to learn to play it.

What I can't figure out is how to get any kind of distorted/unclean tone from this setup. Every video I've watched of the Micro Dark amp, it seems like people just plug it in, turn up the gain, and it sounds pretty decent. But no matter what settings I try on the amp and my guitar, everything just sounds clean to me.

As a total beginner, I just have no idea what's wrong here. Is this a bad gear combo? Is there possibly something wrong with the guitar setup? (didn't do any setup, just took it out of the box) Should I check if something broke?

guitar,"So I recently took my AVII Strat to Guitar Center for maintenance. There was a bit of buzzing and overtones coming form the G string and I asked the tech what he recommend I do. He told me he could either file it down right then and there for free, but that would scratch my guitar's headstock area due to how close the nut was (I should have left right there lol) or he could take it in for servicing remove the ""bone nut"" file it down and put it back together easy which would cost me $109. So I went with option 2 lol.

Fast forward to today, I go to Guitar Center to pick up my guitar and there was a gash size crevice underneath the right edge of the nut and on the opposite side the nut isn't even seated all the way you can see an opening along the nut groove. I took a closer look at the fretboard and there's a crack leading from the right edge of the fretboard, where the nut crevice is located, all the way to its front surface. This has left a puzzle size crack outline on my fretboard üò•.

I keep my guitars in pristine shape, and I asked the tech who was there at the time what happen, he said the guy who serviced it filed the wrong side of the nut????? and that's why my guitar ended up the way it did. I was confused, until I took it home and inspected my guitar against the pictures I was sent from Sweetwater. I realized that the tech had totally replace my bone-nut with a generic plastic feeling nut. I don't know what happen to the original nut but the tech didn't realize that this 61 spec'd guitar has a 7.5 inch radius fretboard and the nut he tried to replace it with clearly wasn't fitting properly(it was probably made for a 9.5 inch radius nut). In the pictures below you can clearly see that the guy was forcing this nut into the fretboard the best way he could and that's why: A. it doesn't fit and: B. there's a large crack in the fretboard.

What should I do, Im going back tomorrow to speak to the manager about my options, I said I would take it to my luthier to see what he recommends but this was before I realized what the tech had really done and especially not telling me the truth about what happened . Can I ask for the full amount the guitar is worth, on the repair receipt the worth is $2,300 or should I ask for a replacement, the guitar is on back order so I dont know when I'd get a new one.

I was wondering if any of you knew who he was or if you could point me towards some more of his playing. A few more videos of him explaining his technique are on the channel but not much else anywhere. A player as good as this is bound to have some more stuff somewhere. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much.

guitar,"Recently, I‚Äôve reached a point where I might like to make my own music(still as a beginner though)
I‚Äôm not at any point where i‚Äôd be performing soon, but I want to get some pedals to spice up my setup, and they‚Äôre just cool. Thing is though, i‚Äôm still a kid looking for a job, and my parents aren‚Äôt super keen on spending hundreds on guitar pedals. My friend told me about some pedal like object, that comes with a mixer studio type thingy that you can download on your phone or computer that has all the effects and whatnot that pedals would give you. Anyways, I‚Äôm trying to find a budget friendly but still decent quality type thing. I‚Äôve looked at iRig‚Äôs but i‚Äôve heard mixed reviews about them so i‚Äôm unsure there. Just asking for recommendations from people with some more experience."
guitar,"So I have a Yamaha F335, and I feel like I‚Äôm out growing it now. Been playing guitar for 5 months by now, I‚Äôm also in classical guitar class at the moment. So being in the class is making me a fast learner. To the point where I think I need to buy a guitar because my F335 steel strings are not really cooperating with my playing. When I go to guitar center play other guitars nylon and steel strings, it feels so much fun and smoother. The F335 literally killing my fingers and I have a tough time playing the barre chords when I play with other guitars the F chords are really easy for me to play

I‚Äôm looking for a Spanish classical guitar. I came across a Cordoba C7 for $220. But I want a guitar that‚Äôs specifically made from Spain. What do you think I should do?  Or should I give my F335 more time ?"
guitar,"I recently got a fender mustang LT 25 to go with my dad's 1988 telecaster. I want to add a Neil young-ish preset to the amp but I decided I should probably update the amp first. The problem is, I don't know how to. I'll go on the fender website and it'll say that the tone app will give me instructions on how to do so but the tone app isn't helping in the slightest. Does anyone know how I can update the firmware on this amp?"

Any advice would help. Thanks!"
guitar,"How do you do it?

I‚Äôm scared of people, especially those my own age. My discharge has left me hurt, reclusive and bitter. But I know shaking and crying over a guitar all alone is no way to spend my twenties. 

I can‚Äôt even play that well, I really just want to see and hear, to be seen and heard. I know a few people who are content brute forcing Metallica without much understanding of their guitar. I‚Äôve tried that. It just feels like a cheap copy, like trying to speak words in a language I never bothered to learn.

If musics a language then it seems pointless to go it alone. I need this to be something I engage with. I want to learn all the sounds, sentences and intricacies alongside someone. To bounce ideas back and forth and grow and evolve. Not something to practice, but something to make. I need to find my friends.

guitar,"
So I recent got to play a Charvel DK24 HSS the other day and it felt AMAZING, way better than my strat or tele. The only problem is that I did/still don‚Äôt have $900 dollars... I‚Äôm on the younger side, so all I have for income is a fast food job at the moment, but I was wondering if anybody could recommend a more budget friendly version of it, or at least something close.

I‚Äôd say my favorite part of the guitar was the thinness of the neck, so if there‚Äôs anything out there that‚Äôs similar enough in dimensions that‚Äôs ideally under maybe $200 (asking for a lot, I know) but could be a bit more expensive.

guitar,"Ever since I've started playing I've been a quiet bedroom guitarist. Even my family hasn't heard me play at full volume.
 Yesterday was the first time I played live, with a mic and an audience and everything. And I hate to say it, but it was mediocre at best. I forgot most of the lyrics, my strumming kept going off, and when the technician came to adjust my mic mid-performance, I completely stopped playing. I was utterly disappointed, but I was also glad my first fucked up performance was in front of a small group and not a large crowd. I was so overwhelmed after the performance, I had a minor breakdown in the back, worrying my friends.
My friends kept reassuring me that I sounded fine but honestly it felt like they just pitied me.

Now that i know i have to practise harder , I hope my next performance will be better??

guitar,"Hey all.

I live in a small apartment and have a wife who goes to bed much earlier than I do, so most of my playing is done on an electric through my fender mustang gtx amp with headphones plugged in. I've recently really gotten into acoustic guitar, and the acoustic presets in the amp with my telecaster don't really sound much like an acoustic guitar. 

Will an acoustasonic through this amp sound like an actual acoustic guitar, or will I be better off finding an acoustic amp with a headphone jack. If so, any recommendations for one?

I've been using guitar rig 6 for a while and I've been having issues with my guitar being much louder than other audio (music from various sources, spotify, youtube, VLC, etc)

I often will use volume controls on the amp models or others but I'm realizing those are all part of my tone and adjusting the volume on one amp or effect is going to color my tone and change how the guitar sounds.

Is there a master volume somewhere I can use to achieve what I want? That is, a lower volume without affecting the tone.

The ""OUT"" meter at the top does have a tick mark indicator that indicates some dB value, I currently have it set to -1.6dB. It does lower my volume but I want to confirm this is acting as a sort of master volume, or is this affecting tone or my sustain in any way? Is there some other option I might be missing?"
guitar,"I have a electrical hum and/or buzz that does NOT go away when touching the strings or a metal part of the guitar.

I've never ran into this before, would anyone happen to know the possible reasons?  How to diagnose?  Would it possibly be the input jack being soldered poorly (it didn't look too bad inside, but not perfect), or is it my amp or guitar cord? Thanks."

guitar,"Hi. I'm 40. I started playing acoustic guitar 5 years ago on my own without taking lessons. For quite some time, I limited myself to playing a few songs with easy chords.

I switched to a guitar that I love, and since then, I've been trying new things and dedicating more time to playing (even though I have little time).

The problem is that I feel stuck. My little finger is very clumsy, and my ring finger isn't very nimble either. I see that the step that would allow me to advance more now would be to achieve the F chord position. I don't know how to do it.

To start, I'm trying with a somewhat simplified version of the chord, leaving the index finger on string 2 and muting strings 1 and 6.

Every day, I try to practice that chord. I see slow progress. I think that I not only need to internalize the physical aspect of the chord, but also break a mental barrier with that chord and with barre chords in general. I've always avoided them. I've also had a mental barrier because I started learning late.

How could I advance and practice those chords and 3 and 4 fingers?"

Today, monday, I decided to play on that guitar again and notice that the low E string has a very annoying buzzing sound. It's mostly noticable on the lower frets and not so much on the higher ones. Also, it doesn't seem to be there when playing an open note. I didn't change anything. Not the action, I did nothing to the nut and certainly didn't fool around with the truss rod. When plugged into the amp I can't hear it through there though.

Anyone has any idea? I tried changing the action to see if that would help but alas. The distance between the low E string on the 12th fret is about 3 to 4 mm right now. I'm NOT going to fool around with the nut or truss rod as I'm reallynot technically enclined and changing the strings and altering the action by lowerinf the bridge is as far as I can do.

guitar,"Hello,

I've recently purchased my first Les Paul (2021 studio). While i love the guitar for certain things, I'm finding both the humbuckers are too hot on clean sounds, to the point where they sound muddy. It is the stock 490R and 498T pickups

I've tried experimenting with the height, but haven't been able to get the results i'm looking for.

A lot of the stuff I play is clean (not clean-on-the-edge-of-break-up, but actually clean) with lots of modulation, and I'm just finding the humbuckers a bit too dull and muddy sounding for my liking.

I'm not expecting the humbuckers to sound like my Jaguar or Jazzmaster, but something with a little more clarity and definition would be great. I'm finding even my Gretsch G5422T (with Filter'Tron pickups) has a lot more of that definition, clarity and (when needed) honk.

Does anybody have any suggestions of brands i should be looking towards? I've seen a few manufacturers do humbucker-sized P90s, but I've never been overenamoured with P90s whenever i've played them (to be fair, this was years ago).

To give some context, I have an amazing 2022 nashville telecaster that I bought about 5 months ago (through GAK). It is still under warranty but the push-pull tone pot is scratchy (always has been) and there seems to be a grounding issue with the guitar (but that could just be my house - which is likely as my bass also does it). I didn't really mind that until a few days ago when the guitar stopped outputting signal and I found that the ground wire has become disconnected from the jack.

I can repair this myself but I do not own a soldering iron. I could send the guitar back for repair but I am worried they will replace the guitar and not repair it (which is illogical since it would cost significantly less and I'm not sure why they would). This wouldn't happen, would it?

I don't want it to be replaced since the grain on this guitar is absolutely awesome looking, through the paint you can see a little bit that perfectly outlines the bottom of the control plate and I love it.

I'm having to replace the nut on a Sire T7, the nut slot is not radiused and it's slightly deeper than a standard Fender one, so the only graph tech nut that fits properly is the rounded Strat one (5000-00), the one with the little nib on the bottom to make it sit on a flat slot as well.

However, since there's no separate fretboard, you can see through the truss rod channel on the center of the slot, right where the nib should sit. Therefore, the nut would be sitting only on the edges and the only way to glue it would be to put a drop of Titebond right on the side of the slot, as opposed to the bottom.

I'm not particularly worried about tone transfer, since it would be snug on the slot on both sides (and at that point the nib would make little to no difference).

Is there an issue I'm not seeing right now?"

guitar,"Hello. I have a Fender Jazzmaster that has a HH-configuration, 3-way switch and a push-pull tone knob for coil splitting. Recently I took a SD Invader bridge pickup out from my another guitar, and thought of replacing the jazzmaster's humbucker with it. I took a look at the electronics and the jazzmaster was wired exactly like this diagram here:

[https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-fxdzp2uudp/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/2417/5093/wd2hh3t11\_01\_\_45715.1470694374.jpg?c=2](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-fxdzp2uudp/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/2417/5093/wd2hh3t11_01__45715.1470694374.jpg?c=2)

Now, I see that the diagram states that is coil tap, and I think they just used the term wrong. Correct me if I am wrong.

What confuses me is that the SD website offers this kind of wiring for my configuration:

[https://www.seymourduncan.com/images/wiring-diagrams/2H\_3G\_1V\_1TppSPL.jpg](https://www.seymourduncan.com/images/wiring-diagrams/2H_3G_1V_1TppSPL.jpg)

The SD one is just like the most diagrams I find when looking up ways to wire a push-pull coil split. And it seems completely logical. However, I would just like to replace my old pickup with the Invader, and leave the configuration like it already is, like in the first picture.

So, I don't understand why the first diagram (and my guitar) is like that? Because most of the diagrams online say to wire neck and bridge pickups symmetrically to the coil-split switch, but my guitar is not wired like that. What am I not understanding?

I really appreciate if someone could help me with this!"

I'm considering buying a guitar with active pickups guitar, and I pretty much landed on those two. (LP body is a must for me :))

I'm a pretty mediocre player, (only playing at home alone). Right now I have Gibson Les Paul Studio, which I absolutelly love. Mostly playing hardcore-punk-metal.

My question is, will I be ever tell the difference between the two? From youtube videos people seems to love both :) I'm mostly looking for something that would be very comfortable to play at. (I have small disability on one of the fingers which I can bend only about half way through) 

Looks like Eclipse has a bit wider neck. Is that a benefit? (I know it can be subjective but on average I guess). No shop near me unfotunatelly have any of those guitars to try them on."
guitar,"Ho everybody. I have a SGR c-1 and I was thinking about upgrading pickups. Since it's not a very expensive guitar, my goal is not to slap on super expensive pickups, but at least something better than stock. Any ideas?"
guitar,"I'm a bass player and I tried messing around with the guitar of my friend during a recent jam session. It seems very difficult for me to play even the simplest of songs. The idea of ""sticking the landing"" when you switch chords is so much harder on the guitar than on the bass. How people manage to place three or more fingers down on the fretboard on an instant is beyond me. And then there's strumming. I find it way more difficult to strum in rhythm as compared to plucking in rhythm on the bass.

When I started Bass, I was able to play simple songs almost instantly. My fretting technique was decent and nothing got in my way when I tried my hand at playing simple songs. In Bass, you don't have to be Geddy Lee in order to be serviceable on the instrument. You can simply play root notes and lock-in with the drummer in order to stay in time. Sure it may be simple, but it's not incorrect in any way. Playing like this does the job and it's definitely serviceable for most songs out there.

On guitar, if you can't land on the chords cleanly whenever there's a chord change in the song, you're toast. In order to be serviceable on the guitar, it feels like you need to have more dexterity as compared to the bass.

Both instruments are highly technical in their own rig"

guitar,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIpZZTe\_WnI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIpZZTe_WnI) 

Song is in D standard. But I learn it in drop D tuning, because I it is how I started to learn it. There are 2 riffs and I can't play transition between them. First riff starts at 0:54 and all notes are 1/8. Riff repeats 4 times. It is down picking whole time. I can play it.

&amp;#x200B;

Next riff starts with 4 short 1/16 notes. It is tremolo picking. First time I can't play those 4 notes.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I did. I wrote those 2 riffs in FL Studio and slowed it down. Original tempo is 96 BPM. I slowed it down to 85 BPM. I was playing it 5 minutes. Then I was slowly increasing tempo. And playing it faster 5 minutes. Then increasing tempo etc. And when I do that I can play it.

&amp;#x200B;

But when I play it with song I always play those 4 notes badly when there is transition between riffs.

Hey all! I have an 1990s Les Paul standard and I have had issues with fret buzz. I had a complete tune up in November at the local guitar center after I acquired it from my uncle. Then in early January I got fret buzz badly on the high strings so went back to guitar center and they fixed it up.

It's been a little over a month and I am now having buzzing again. This time on the low strings (E/A) when playing power chords (even when they are open). It is coming through the amp which it very annoying. I can avoid by playing super soft but normal strumming/picking it comes through.

guitar,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to pick up my first electric guitar. I've done some research and mostly got it down to 3 guitars, yet I can't decide between the three.

&amp;#x200B;

I am mostly interested in playing:

midwest emo (american football, marietta)

emo (brand new, sunny day real estate)

pop punk (green day, mayday parade)

indie (the 1975, two door cinema club)

&amp;#x200B;

I give preference to the cleans of midwest emo first, but I'm also interested in playing indie, pop punk, and whatever else with a bit of gain (nothing too heavy like metal though).

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen most midwest emo bands play Fender teles with jazzmasters and SSS strats also being common options. Meanwhile most of pop punk seems to be played on any guitars with humbuckers.

&amp;#x200B;

My current options:

Squier Affinity Telecaster

SSS Squier Affinity Stratocaster

HSS Squier Affinity Stratocaster

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm torn between the three, afraid that tele might sound too thin for anything else other than midwest emo, but strats, especially the HSS variant, won't be bright enough for midwest emo. Will I even be able to tell the difference as a beginner?

&amp;#x200B;

I've read through similar threads saying that it's mostly the effects that matter, but which would be the best guitar while I'm just starting out and not looking to buy any additional gear other than a practice amp?

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you guys can help me choose, feel free to suggest other guitars too. Thanks in advance!"

I'll link some pictures of it from a couple years ago, but it's just started happening again. I don't press very hard on the strings btw.

I've got really sweaty hands which I think is contributing but I'm not sure. I don't moisturise my hands because I'd imagine it would make it worse, just looking for any help because I have to take a couple days off playing to let them heal and its really inconvenient aha.

guitar,"I'm shopping for my dream guitar, I've had some great cheap used guitars that I've loved and made improvements on them to make them play and sound better but I think I want a 7-String and I can't just add an extra string to my current guitar. But with that said trying to get some feed back on how a 7 string feels as well as other technical stuff to decide if I really want a 7 string or if I would be happier with a 6 string with specific qualities.

I currently have a BC Rich Warlock Bronze Tribal that I found on FB Marketplace that I absolutely love, it was trashed and only $200. I had the neck re-adjusted, pickups cleaned and re-wired, and tuned for intonation. It plays amazing now! The pickups and tone don't sound as good as other Warlocks I've had or even other guitars in general. I'm thinking of switching to active pickups for the new guitar. I don't play live, I play at home to backing tracks to have fun. I like a wide-range of music to play to but I kinda live in the Tool, Disturbed, Metallica, Deftones, Chevelle area mostly due to tunings. (Standard, Drop D, Drop Db, and the occasional Standard b)

I'd like to play more drop tunings like Drop C or even Drop B without that loose rattle that comes with it so I've been reading on scale length and found out my guitar is 24.75"" it handles the switch between drop and standard tunings a lot better than other guitars I've had in the past and was thinking of buying something 25.5"" scale length. And obviously I think you see why I also want the 7th string cause Korn but also interested in other bands that play 7 as well but noticed that 25.5"" is a common scale length for 7 string guitars. 

I've always loved the Les Paul body style so was looking into the ESP LTD EC-1007 but then last night I found a decently priced Schecter Damian 6 that also comes in 25.5"" scale length and with EMG active pickups. Very open to other suggestions.

TLDR - Can anyone give me their experience with 25.5"" scale length going back and forth between different tunings as well as is active pickups worth it for someone who only plays at home? Also 7-String curious.."

guitar,"Hey guys, 

Wanted to see if anyone else has had similar experiences. So I played a lot over a decade ago, mainly on my Ovation 1771lx. I ended up stopping in college and then a decade ago I bought a Martin GPCPA4 which I LOVE, but only really started finally playing again a few months ago. I had been playing a ton and decided to buy a Taylor GS mini for just chillin and oh my god I am in love with this thing. The 3/4 size is so nice. I have slightly above average hands and never had any issues with chord shapes or reaching positions on a full size, but the mini just feels amazing. I also think I prefer the sound to the Martin, which is obviously much boomier. I picked up the Martin last night for the first time in a few days and it felt so cumbersome compared to the mini.

Just wondering if anyone else has felt the same way. Im sure some of it is that we all favor our newest gear, and that over time as the ‚Äúshine‚Äô of the Taylor wears off I‚Äôll play them rotation, but damn, out of the gate this little guy is all I need!"

guitar,"Hello there,

I recently bought an electric guitar with an audio interface and would like to use the many different apps for learning how to play the guitar. Since I don't want to disturb anyone at home, I plan to use headphones most of the time.

I wanted to ask if there's a way to connect my phone to the headphones/guitar so that the sound is also picked up by the phone.

Alternatively, if I download a smartphone emulator on my PC, is it possible to use the learning apps with my audio interface (with headphones) and have the sound registered in the app?

guitar,"Just wanted to share my two cents on this and see how others feel.

I've played guitar for 10 years, I've been in bands for like 5 years, we play local venues two/three times a month, we record and release music. That motivation to practice and keep getting better that I felt before joining bands has diminished.

It's that feeling of ""Oh I know enough now, I don't want to be a guitar virtuoso, I just want to play, write and be creative"" To be fair, it is much more rewarding to write a new song in 2 hours than it is two hammer out scales for 2 hours instead. Also it's the case of where spending time writing music is a MUST if you want to sustain your band. I have college and a part time job too, and if I have 2 hours a day on guitar, I kinda need to spend that time penciling ideas rather than practicing.

Anyone else in the same spot as me, and if you ever were in the past, what did you end up doing?"

That being said, I‚Äôm writing a piece that requires two eBows (or something similar) and I‚Äôve started using both and I still encounter this issue, even if I put a brand new battery in it!

Hi,
I ordered an exclusive Gibson from a dealer in July of '21. It is only this past week or two that it finally arrived. I gave it plenty of time to acclimate to the temperature and finally opened it yesterday, only to find it had some pretty decent finish checking (I've definitely seen much worse on this forum). 

I wouldn't even mind the finish checking if it happened after a year of use or whatever. But the first day I have it? After waiting so long with very little notice it's just disappointing. Especially since it's through no fault of my own. 

I've since reached out to support and they're offering $100 refund. Am I being reasonable in thinking that's a pittance? I'm pretty sure there won't be any replacement guitars and there's not really a comparably specced model available. I'm also glad with the way the rosewood turned out since their quality is very iffy these days."

All of that being  said, there was some obvious damage, so I immediately went to a shop to  see where I landed on the ""got screwed-ometer"", and they said it wasn't  too bad, but repairs like a new bridge and such would cost about \~450.

It  looks like a few have sold for $400, but also looks like a few are  selling for $800. I guess I'm a bit unsure of whether or not I should  put the money into it, and wanted some opinions.

I had a 7 string back in the day with a Floyd rose and everytime I changed the strings the Floyd rose would sit way forward and I couldn‚Äôt get it back. I wanna be able to change my own strings on my guitar without having to pay someone else to do it as I feel like that‚Äôs important and I know I‚Äôll do the job I want done. Any advice on how to change it without having to worry about the bridge getting wonky?

guitar,"how do you deal with wrist pain in the fretting hand?

been playing for 3-4 years now pretty much daily, mostly just jamming to random tracks, but recently i decided to start taking things way more seriously and have a dedicated practice routine.

this resulted in me using my pinky seriously for the first time ever, which is causing some quite uncomfortable pain.

it starts on the outer part of my wrist, stretches through the hand muscle around, and underneath, the pinky all the way to the finger itself.

any tips on relieving this? my thumb is behind my neck, i'm sitting in a classical position with a footrest, i'm not fretting too hard.. i'm most definitely experienced with the instrument, but have no idea how to move on, since the concern of a major injury is definitely there.

help would be appreciated &lt;3"

guitar,"Hi friends! I‚Äôve recently started jamming with a band for the first time in decades, and I can‚Äôt hear myself playing. I‚Äôve got the volume, as I can feel the sound (and the singer asks me to turn down). And if I take out my earplugs, it is rather ear splitting. 

I can hear either of the other guitar players clear as a bell. They aren‚Äôt louder, but much more clear and full sounding, without being obnoxiously loud. 

I‚Äôm playing various charvels and ibanezes plugged straight into a 5150iii 50w, 2x12 v30 cab. I run a lot more midrange than I did back in my teenage metal days. One guitarist plays a nice PRS into an expensive looking pedal board into a Marshall MG100 and 4x10. The other guitarist plays a cheap Ibanez into a Vox multi fx board into a crate tube amp and 4x12. All the cabinets are along the same wall, and I have tried standing in different spots. 

Is there a setting I should be messing with on my amp? Some different piece of equipment or effect I should consider? I just want to sound ‚Äúbigger‚Äù without being louder, if that makes any sense."

To give an idea - I was considering a Parker nitefly based on it being sort of a strat on steroids. I like strats, I like trems (not floyds). But it's not easy to find a Parker in my area, and I know great care needs to go into buying one used. So just an example of where my mind is at.

guitar,"Guitar teacher here, a lot of my students who are attempting to move to the next level (from basic powerchord rock) still have their terrible starter pack instruments and amplifiers. Often it's easy to convince them to get a new guitar after a while, but they really underestimate the importance of amps. Even my most advanced students with expensive American made instruments are still using their starter pack Squier amp.

The problem is that I think a lot of amplifiers in the price range have become very hard to use. Perfect example: Line 6 really upped their game with the Spider V from the previous models, but the digital control system will make every Fortnite tablet kid's brain melt.

All the ones I'm very familiar with are the same way. A lot of my students will still ask ""which way is up?"" adjusting the knobs (not even just the beginners. ;.;)

What are some amps still around that fit this criteria?:

‚Ä¢Under $400

‚Ä¢PHYSICAL AMPLIFER, cannot be plugins is a lot of my students don't have access to computers

‚Ä¢Solid State, no tubes (unless something like a Valvetronix)

‚Ä¢Has a clean channel and USABLE distortion, enough for a variety of styles

‚Ä¢Independent ontrols for gain, bass, middle, and treble

‚Ä¢Analog control surface, no screens or presets

‚Ä¢Lo-tech, easy to operate and dial in a good sound

‚Ä¢Modeling is fine but even that makes kids brains melt"

guitar,"Hey guys, I'm a beginner at guitar, but I think I've noticed a problem with my guitar. Whenever I go to pluck the first 3 strings, I hear this ""slap"" against the bottom frets, like it doesn't even have the chance to ring out. I googled it, and turns out my action was too low, so I adjusted it, but it just makes it so that the ""slap"" happens on the opposite end of the guitar. So, for example if I were to hold down near the top of the string and then play it, I would get ""slap sound"" but when I adjust the action to be higher, the ""slap"" now happens at the top of the fret board when I hold the string down near the bottom. So, now I'm just confused as to what the problem is.

guitar,"I bought this guitar a couple of weeks ago on Reverb and it was shipped from across Canada. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt purchase a guitar online without playing it and seeing it in-person first, especially secondhand, however, the sellers feedback made me feel a bit better about the purchase, but it was still a bit of a gamble. I‚Äôm really glad I went through with it. This guitar is gorgeous, plays like a dream, and was packaged very securely. The only ‚Äúissue‚Äù which is not a big deal at all is some fret sprout on top of the fingerboard. I‚Äôm not sure if it was kept humidity controlled but everything else seems to be working fine.

It has EMG 81/85‚Äôs, rosewood fingerboard, locking tuners, two volumes and a tone (could be other way around), and came with a case which is always nice. I dig the les paul shape. Its thinner and much lighter than a les paul, and the body may even be slightly smaller, but it sits nice, plays great, and has 24 frets. EMGs are also new to me but I think theyre a nice change to what I‚Äôm used to and certainly fit my playstyle.

I haven‚Äôt had a ton of time to play it but I‚Äôm looking forward to getting to know her better now that I finished my midterms lol.

I attached the pictures the seller took because they really capture how good this guitar looks (at least I think so) 

Thanks for looking! Let me know what yall think

guitar,"I just watched this YT lesson on natigating the fretboard using colours. I read the comments and it was a mixed bag of ""this is useless"" and ""this is the greatest lesson ever"".

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwSBtuWkhiA&amp;ab_channel=MikeGeorge

Personally I don't see how viewing the notes as colours is helpful. How on earth would I even view them as colours in the first place? Unless he's saying to literally put coloured stickers on the fretboard, as he has done in the video.

Even if I put these stickers on the fretboard, it still doesn't make sense. He's saying that somehow by seeing the colours for each note, I would somehow then know the correct notes for any major/minor scale. I just don't see how that works in practise.

So at 11:07 he plays a G major scale starting on 5th fret of string 4. I don't understand how I would automatically know the scale, based on the colours. What have the colours got to do with knowing the notes of the scale.

The way I could figure out the correct notes is by using the WWHWWWH approach. Obviously this isn't a good way to do it in real time though.

The way I've learned to navigate the fretboard is by memorising the 7 major scale patterns (3 notes per string). I've also memorised the 5 pentatonic scales. I still have to think about it sometimes when playing, but I feel the patterns are becoming more ingrained the more I use them.

I do wonder if there's an easier way of doing this. When pro guitarists are playing, are they thinking about scale patterns when playing, or is there an easier way to do it?

I'm alway interested in trying to find new ways to view the fretboard, but I just don't see how using colours is helpful, or even possible in a real situation i.e. not having coloured stickers on the fretboard.

Interested to hear how others approach learning to play various scales/keys."
guitar,"I know - super typical, and I did research for about a week before posting this lol. But I'm seeking advice on a quality, versatile, feature rich, and long lasting electric guitar for around $1500 to $2k at most. I'm in a place where I can't just run down to the local shops and try out guitars, so I'm looking to narrow it down.

Been playing for over 20 years, casually, and mostly low to mid range guitars. I don't gig or anything, not since high school anyway lol. So I'm pretty familiar with the budget to mid range end of electric guitars, but never really gawked over high end stuff since I never felt the need to have it.

But yeah I think I'm at the point where I know I will never stop playing, I know what I like/dislike, and ready to just have a quality guitar that I like and will last.

I like trems (not floyds), I like extra tone options (pickup splits and what not), not a super chunky body and neck. Would also like quality tuners, hardware, electronics, etc. For sound, like I said versatile. I'll funk out one moment, punk out another, then play some nostalgic Hawaiian tunes I grew up with. I do enjoy playing leads, not like I shred or anything. I don't need it to sound excellent at everything, just pretty good at a handful of things.

I'd say of all the guitars I've played over the years, strat types have been my favorite. Thought about a Parker nitefly, but it's hard to find where I'm at - and I know great care needs to go into buying a used one. I guess a super strat of some sort would be appealing - not necessarily a strat body, but a strat type of experience.

guitar,"I‚Äôve recently been engaged in some heated discussion about this topic and I‚Äôm wondering what the common opinion is here.  People seem convinced that the type of wood used on a solid body electric guitar can affect the guitar‚Äôs electric amplified signal- even the fretboard!

Recently I‚Äôve been watching [Jim Lill‚Äôs](https://youtu.be/n02tImce3AE) incredible YouTube videos in which he breaks down a guitar to its most basic elements in an attempt to figure out where the tone comes from.  I came away from that video convinced that it‚Äôs all about pickups/electronics, but some people are still convinced that tone is in the wood.  Clearly, this is the case for an acoustic, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like it would make a difference on an electric guitar. I‚Äôm also convinced 9/10 guitarists couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between a maple and a rosewood fretboard in a blind sound test.  Maybe by feel, but not tone alone.

I‚Äôll leave one more anecdote:  I‚Äôve heard for years that an SG is a brighter sounding guitar because it has a thinner mahogany body, but I‚Äôve also heard that a Les Paul is brighter because of the maple cap on the top of the body.  Which is true, or is it all a placebo effect and we just hear with our eyes?"
guitar,"Hi everyone. Relatively experienced player here, but not very good on guitar tech. I‚Äôve just restrung my Fender Strat with D‚ÄôAddardio NYXL 10-46 instead of Regular Slinky EBs in 10s.

Having restrung my floating bridge was initially very high but after some stretching and retuning it has lowered. However, my high E, B and G strings now ultra low compared to the others. What the hell has happened? I was meant to be recording today so it‚Äôs not looking good!

So I ask you, guitarists of the reddit machine, what DON'T you regret selling and why? 

I'll start off - every import B.C. Rich Beast I ever owned. No regrets. The body style was comfy to play sitting down and it made a hell of a wall hanger, but (in my case) the necks always needed a shim for proper break angle due to the insanely high mounted wraparound bridge that still had the action a mile off the fretboard when decked, neck warp, neck humps, and of course the potential to ding the horns on any nearby object. I still own a few import BC's so I'm not shitting on all of them, but that's my tale! 

My honorable mention goes to the couple of modern guitars I've owned which were outfitted with a single-action truss rod. Not psyched on those at all."

If you have any guitar source files without effects that you'd be willing to share, please email them to me at [**augustlab.martin@gmail.com**](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/redirect/away?url=mailto%3Aaugustlab.martin%40gmail.com)

I promise to give credit to all contributors in my project and share the progress with the community.  
Thank you in advance for your help, and I can't wait to see what we can create together!

Best regards,"

guitar,Everything works fine but when I like to put some overdrive it doesn't work. I try every possible way but still don't release the supposed sound. Is anyone know where the problem is?
guitar,"For Christmas I got some Ernie ball 9‚Äôs for my guitar. I just purchased an epiphone les Paul ultra iii, which played perfectly with the old strings. No fret buzz or difficulty with the frets. Now that I have restrung it, it sounds very much like acoustic strings, and it rattles when I fret a string (power chords sound awful.) do I need to get it set up, alter the truss rod or just get new authentic strings?"
guitar,"Here's a cover of this powerfull guitar solo I made. What do you think?

guitar,"An advertisement I came over claimed to be selling all their instruments for next to nothing because of store mismanagement. The website itself looks legit, but it bothers me that they are only selling guitars and no other gear.

I feel like its a scam, but by the off change it could be great opportunity to get a cheap guitar I thought I might ask for a second opinion?"
guitar,"Over the years, I've heard Gibson quality control was terrible, especially for its studio models.  Over the last few years, I've been hearing the same about Fender MIMs.  However, lately, I'm not hearing much about Gibson, at all.

Has Gibson's quality control improved?  Is Fender's becoming inconsistent?  Are they about the same?  The cheapest Fender is about $850 (US) and cheapest Gibson about $1500.  Do you think they are they worth the money?"
guitar,i'm considering purchasing some pups and basically just want something low output PAF similar to angus. I heard SH-1Bs are pretty good for ac/dc.
guitar,"First of all I just want to say that I‚Äôm new to this, anyways I‚Äôve been thinking about creating a 5150 guitar out of my white Kramer Beretta special and I‚Äôm going to use the white as a base for my stripes. That being said the head stock has the golden Kramer logo decal buried under the barettas finish and since I want to keep the white without digging into the finish it‚Äôs got me thinking a bit. If I sand it off will that take a big chunk of the finish off? Should I just use another water decal of my replacement logo of choice and somehow find one with a square white overlay to hide the original? Will I just have to spend a tiny bit more money for a white can with potential to coat 8 guitars for it just to be wasted on one head stock? If anyone can just get my head guided in the right direction it would be nice."
guitar,This is a question I‚Äôve been wondering for some time now.
guitar,"I need some help with my acoustic guitar. I took it to the luthier because I was experiencing fret buzzes on the lower frets (1-5) of the low E string. 

The luthier found out that it buzzes the most on those frets but the guitar also buzzes with the note G almost everywhere across the fingerboard.

Here's what he have tried to do: 

\- raised the action, didn't help  

\- changed the saddle and the nut, didn't help 

\- file the frets down a bit, also didn't help 

&amp;#x200B;

He called today and said he's out of ideas on what's going on.  He said it might be down to the fingerboard thing because the strings vibrate and hit the frets. 

Am I out of luck here? I really like this guitar."
guitar,"Using an MXR ten band EQ pedal in the effects loop, how could I replicate that classic/hard rock Marshall sound on a 5150iii 6L6? The blue channel alone gets me in the ballpark, but it's still missing something. Any specific frequencies I should boost/cut? Thought I'd ask here since I'm far from a genius when it comes to in-depth EQing, and I'm not too familiar with the typical EQ curve of a Marshall anyway."
guitar,"Hey everybody!
I've been playing guitar for a couple of years and i play a lot of pieces that doesnt require being an amazing guitar player. I'm really motivated to improve but i don't know how to go on and which steps to take to become the player i wanna be. I feel like im stuck and would like to hear your tips !"
guitar,"I'm trying to build an ampless board and get stuck between these two options. I want something that is easy to use, sound good through headphones and can take pedals well...
Do somone have experience with any of these pedals?"
guitar,"I primarily play a Tele, and have a P90 LP Special.  Both are great.  I'm jonesing for a humbucker guitar, and am a little more partial to Fenders in general.  Looking at the HH Tele's, Jazzmaster's and Jaguar's.  The heaviest I play is in hard rock territory so I don't need high gain shredder. 

Aside from the scale length difference of the Jaguar, what are pros and cons of each?  I'm looking at the modern player versions primarily.  I'm gravitating towards Tele, but am thinking of going to a different model for versatility and a different enough sound to make it make sense."
guitar,"Used to run an ISP Decimator and NS2, and they were decent given the tech of the time. Decimator wasn‚Äôt very fast and NS2 was a tone killer. Recently got the MXR Smart Gate and, well, despite playing with all the settings and rotating the knobs I can‚Äôt quite get it to where it is both effective and not sucking tone. 

Now, I‚Äôm running three amps at once through a Geirge Lynch Tripler‚Ä¶and, well, as *absolutely ridiculous* as this sounds, I need three noise gates. Looking to use the four cable method. From the look of things, the KMA Pylon, Revv G8, EHX Silencer, TC Sentry and perhaps 1-2 others would fit the bill. 

I‚Äôm looking for the most transparent tone possible while still having a fast clamp on unwanted noise. So far seems like the Pylon is the winner, but I‚Äôd like to hear any input from owners of these (or other) noise gates. 

TIA"
guitar,"I played one of these at long &amp; McQuade tonight and couldn't put it down. Probably would have walked out with it for I wasn't a student rn.

guitar,"I‚Äôve been working on Nutshell by Alice in Chains for my first song, and i‚Äôve got all the chords down and about half of the strumming pattern, but I‚Äôm entirely stumped on what happens between the first hammer and the last hammer. 

This is what I have so far:

guitar,I wanted to install a new Seymour Duncan jb pickup into my Yamaha Pacifica. I got it on and working slightly but the signal was quiet so I looked again at the wiring and the green wire that goes with the bare wite from the jb pickup connecting to the volume pot had snapped so I stripped some green wire back and wired it the same way as it was before it snapped and now there is no sound at all. I‚Äôm just confused and have no idea what could be wrong everything is wired the same as it was when it was working a little bit but there‚Äôs nothing now.
guitar,"First of all, go easy on me, I‚Äôm quite new to pickups üòÜ

I have a Mexican made Stratocaster from the mid 1990s, HSS configuration.  I was very interested in playing guitar at that time but then didn‚Äôt really have time with school.  Now, years later, I‚Äôve really gotten into playing again, and want to start writing and recording my own music.  Style-wise though, it‚Äôll be quite different.  I‚Äôve worked a lot on classical and flamenco guitar but also want to incorporate electric guitar as well.  So I‚Äôm trying to figure out what I might want to do as far as pickups on the Strat.

What am I looking for?  Something that will sound great clean - not too bright but with good definition, not muddy.  I actually have a pretty good selection of effects pedals and won‚Äôt shy away from experimenting with sounds, so I guess I want something kinda versatile.  Not planning to play any hard rock or metal‚Ä¶love both, but my musical brain doesn‚Äôt seem to come up with such ideas!  I think I want something that‚Äôs going to be sensitive and nuanced since I rarely use a pick and want a good dynamic range.

I‚Äôve only looked at pickups a little, and there are just tons of them.  I need some guidance as far as what to consider.

A few other thoughts:

1) I‚Äôm open to a new pickguard both to upgrade electronics and change configuration (I don‚Äôt know that going to a SSS would suit my tastes but perhaps there‚Äôs something out there?  Also open to HSH.  Basically, anything.)

2) This opens a whole other can of worms but I‚Äôm also interested in extended range guitars and have a budget Ibanez 7 string and a Schecter Omen-8.  It‚Äôd be a bonus if down the road I might have the option of upgrading pickups on them with something comparable.  However, this is far from a major consideration, just perhaps a bonus."
guitar," Would you string a Takamine GN20CE NS with nylon or steel. This is the one with electronics. I have a Matsuoka MU 20 that has amazing sound but I am struggling with the classical neck. Getting old. Can't fret easily. I believe ( and have yet to find out ) that the Takamine with the 12""radius will allow me better clarity across the fret. any thoughts?"
guitar," 

So, I bought a Jackson JS22-7 because I've always wanted a 7-String, and it was $269.99 CAD with a boat load of 'This Guitar is not terrible at all' reviews.  
Clearly at that price point - a lot has been sacrificed in the name of price.  
But the Guitar FEELS GREAT! It really does!  
So, I'm thinking about pouring some money into it, and just having a fun Monster of a 7-String I can just chug around with.

Right now I'm thinking Fishman Fluence pickups  
Gotoh locking tuners  
Some new knob hardware  
I'm incredibly fine with the bridge . . so . . I'm not going to touch it.  
And a Kill Switch. Why? Because I think they're ridiculous and look fun as hell and why not toss it into the Monster project.

Thoughts? Is this dumb? Silly? Amazing?

Does anyone have a cheap guitar that's been massively overhauled?"
guitar,"Hey guys, after a few years of consistent playing I‚Äôm confident enough to dive into the realm of pedals and tone effects.

guitar,"I was wondering what you guys think would be the tonal difference between a set of pickups (say strat pickups) where a ""stock set"" are raised high compared to a 5% overwound set set quite low, almost into the pickguard.

Hoping someone can help out with some clarification about fishman fluence pickups.

Does anyone have an above average experience or knowledge about these that can either confirm I‚Äôm even reasonably close to right or if I‚Äôm totally wrong?

I play with some friends in a small basement. At the moment we‚Äôre just using our phones to record some songs but I‚Äôd like to switch to a way to record the entire session in hopefully better quality. That way we can capture the best moments and use them for song songwriting and quality improvement.

I have had a American pro 2 strat for a year or so. The floating trem was a good novelty for a while , all my other guitars are hard tails , but I‚Äôm thinking of decking it. Trem is fun at times but it also has its annoyances. Unison bends , changing tuning on the fly  etc.

guitar,"For whatever reason, I recently got the itch to buy a new guitar. I kind of want something different to add to my humble collection. Is two a collection? I still have my first, a late 90s Yamaha Pacifica 112v my parents bought new. It's my everyday player and I love it. It's survived several major moves, and less than desirable storage conditions when I hung up the hobby for a few years. But I was forever plagued by the thought that it is just a ""beginner"" ""budget"" guitar just slightly better than something you'd find in a kit with a less than passable amp etc...

After picking up the hobby again I decided it was time to invest a little more money and get something in the next tier. Two years ago I picked up the Epiphone ES 335. I always thought the semi hollow body looked neat and it has the added benefit of giving me audible feed back for those times I don't want to plug in but want to dabble. I like it, it's pretty, sounds great, feels good, and at this point Epiphone is name I'm told thats just as good as Gibson, no regrets. But I still find myself reaching for the Yamaha 90 percent of the time.

Recently I decided I want a blue guitar, don't know why, blues not even my favorite color, but something about that blue maple pattern on a guitar just calls to me. That was the only criteria I had so I decided to refine that a bit. Ive wanted to own a single cut and I've wanted to own a Floyd Rose. In that weird way that phones work I got a pop up ad for the Kramer Assault 220. It was almost perfect, single cut with a Floyd Rose but... No blue option.

So I put my criteria into sweetwater and found the  ESP LTD EC-1000FR QM. It's perfect, it checks all the marks I've given myself. Even more shocking, my wife saw it and the price and said ""why not get it"" no hint of frustration or sarcasm, no indication that I'd regret it later.

Why not is the real question and what brings me here today. Anxiety/buyers remorse is my current answer. That's a lot of money to spend on one guitar. One I can't go test drive in my area, I have to buy it, ship it and run the risk of either thinking its ""fine"" but still taking a back seat to the Yamaha, or hating it and learning the in's and out's of refunding an online purchase.

Is it still worth it these days to spend that much on a single guitar or, if you have experience, this guitar? Im an intermediate, arm chair player at best. Playing is a hobby I do for me, I have no delusions that I'm gonna be on stage or churning out singles. Or, would I be better off taking the cost of the one and splitting it into two mid tier guitars like the Kramer 220 to satisfy the LP / Floyd Rose criteria, and maybe something like the Schecter Omen to get my pretty blue, plus they have a 7 string option that would also be something new to mess around with?

I realize this is a very subjective question. But if you think about it objectively, in your experience do you get more out of a $1000 guitar vs a $500, is that even considered a high end guitar? Would you rather have more options across several guitars, or put all the features into one?"
guitar,"I have a 2002 Squier Standard HH Strat, made in Indonesia. As far as I can tell online, this should take a 6mm tremolo arm. I bought 4 pack of 6mm arms from Amazon, and they are actually 5.8mm in diameter (the widest part of the thread, not the narrow inside of the thread). I also borrowed an arm from a friend and it was also 5.8mm.

Although the threading is correct and I didn't force it in, the arm is just a bit loose and wobbly. I know this can be fixed using teflon tape or something, but are these arms supposed to fit tighter?"
guitar,"**Backstory**: 

I want the holy grail of acoustic guitars - the [Gibson j45](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Facousticmusic.org%2Ficonic-guitars-the-gibson-j-45%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw1CLBnF3vlVZ9fxY-3aCb8F&amp;ust=1676746448926000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCPjL6rWdnf0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAF). 

**But it‚Äôs $3000.** 

So I've been looking for a Gibson j45 knockoff for quite a while, that encapsulates all things j45:

* spruce /mahogany
* satin /semi gloss finish
* white tuners
*  white binding
* slope shoulder
* sunburst (proper blend)
* black fretboard
* Short scale neck
* That nutty, warm woody tone
* And of course, that beautifully clean [headstock shape and logo](https://www.12fret.com/wp-content/uploads/ngg_featured/gibson-j45-1949-cons-head-front-1.jpg)

We all know that distinct look that every other knockoff just can't seem to hit. And holy shit it feels like I've been through 99% of them. Hashtag paralysis by analysis heh. 

I settled on the [AMI \(Sigma\) JM-SG45](https://www.sigma-guitars.com/acoustic-guitars/sg-series/jm-sg45/) for $800. Aesthetically it's a beauty. Solid top, semi gloss satin finish, short scale, Chinese combined with German manufacturing - and while no guitar can truly hit that j45 sound, it's a decent honorable mention.

Other honorable mentions:

* [Guild DS240](https://guildguitars.com/g/ds-240-memoir-vintage-sunburst/)  $450

* [Alvarez Delta 00e TSB](https://alvarezguitars.com/guitar/delta00etsb/)  $450

The Alvarez 00 sounds amazing, solid top, great price, scalloped bracing, headstock logo looks great, and has the best low-end sound of any folk guitar I've heard..  But the gloss finish is too shiny and the sound hole binding has a reflective glitter thing going on. 

So instead I'll go with the slope shouldered, more expensive but closer to the J45 - AMI SG45.

guitar,"I use GuitarTuna for tuning my guitar, but, as far as I can tell, it only lets me tune to standard tuning without paying a fee. I want to try some weird tunings on my guitar for some songs. 

I mainly ran into this issue while trying to cover Yellow by Coldplay, where the high E string is tuned down to D#. I know I can keep adjusting it until it matches the 4th fret of the B string, but my ear isn't really trained enough to get it right. Another example would be Californication by RHCP, where the B string is slightly out of tune in the original track.

I've downloaded a few tuning apps but none seem to be exactly what I want. I also got a (cheap) tuner from Amazon that just doesn't even detect when I'm plucking half the time lol.

What I'm looking for is an app where I can, for example, click on the high E string in the app and say I want this to be D#, and then start tuning. Does anybody know an app like this that won't charge me for non-standard tuning? Or could anyone recommend a tuner I could order online?"
guitar,"This is on my PRS SE, the trem is set to spec and I don‚Äôt want to lower it anymore. 

I assume my options are either to take the saddle off and shave just a little bit off the bottom of it, or lower the trem a tiny bit more if I really have to. 

Am I missing anything? Not a big deal I just want that high E a smidge lower.

Thanks!"
guitar,"Getting fuller tone from Martin Parlour guitar

I own a Martin parlour [guitar](https://images.app.goo.gl/CFtpTKfKSv57v6Kk7), with the Ed Sheeran branding. I really liked it when I tried it at the guitar store. When I brought it home it sounded fine, but over time it began sounding like a toy. The sound seems thin, and there is no resonance.   I thought it first the strings just need to be replaced. I have tried a few different types of strings, but no real improvement. I am wondering if there is maintenance I need to do on this guitar?  The size is great but I just don‚Äôt enjoy playing it.

guitar,"Hey guys, I've just started learning and I've started making my way through Justin Guitars beginner lessons. I'm only a few chords in and I wanna practice a ton, but my fingers are holding me back because they keep getting sore.

guitar," My end goal for learning the guitar is to cover as many of my favorite songs as I can without relying on a tab (either by choice or because there really isn't any existing tabs). And maybe record myself a YouTube cover of sorts.

For that goal I'd picked up the guitar, and bought a bass and drums to fiddle with too. I'm not too good, I reckon about Grade 1-2. Guitar I stopped at Grade 4.

**But what does the experience of producing a cover actually feel like?** I can't visualize or imagine how someone who's at that skill level does things like that. Without that visualization and headspace I'm a little lost and am worried I'm going the wrong way or being real inefficient about it.

So I was hoping if anyone in this forum could share how they cover songs, and what their thought processes are like.

Some of the questions I have about the covering process are below. I really don't know how I would answer those questions - yes I'm that lost.

1. Would you write super detailed GuitarPro scores, or would you just write the key and chord progression? And why or why not?

2. Do you prefer authentic/accurate covers that stick to only 1 instrument track, or do you make a mish-mash good-enough cover that juggles the Solo, Rhythm and Vocals? Would you convert rock to fingerstyle, or add in a new solo section etc. And why?

3. Do you produce backing drums/pianos, or do you play over the song?

4. How long do you take to complete your song cover?

5. After completion, do you continue practising the cover regularly, or do you file it away and move to another song?

6. Do you worry your ability to cover the song will regress if you stopped practicing? Especially if your cover was way too detailed?

7. Do you revisit and update your cover? What kind of changes would you make? Is it ever going to be complete?"
guitar,"I'm not quite a beginner but I wouldn't call myself an intermediate. Playing for 12 months, I know basic music theory and spend most of my times learning solos with tabs I find on YouTube. I can play solos such as Hotel California, Slow Dancing in a Burning Room, or Little Wing, but not 100% clean but to the point where it actually sounds decent.

Coming to the point, I see in most solo covers that at certain parts they slide to the end of the fret before moving on with the next notes, as if there is a very small time window before the next notes on the tabs are coming. This is also never visible on the tabs and I don't quite know why you do it but it definetly looks cool and more professional. However, when I search up ""guitar slides"" on YouTube, the results are not exactly what i mean. How can I look this up to learn it?

I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post a YouTube link as an example.

Thank you very much"

guitar,"Hey all, long time lurker first time poster.

I have been playing electric for about 18 months. I am still pretty terrible, but getting better slowly (can play simple chord progressions and songs, learning rhythm, etc).

I learned on an epiphone studio. It is a fun guitar, and I definitely did not ""max out"" on it in terms of my skill level, but I always knew it wouldn't be my ""forever"" guitar.

But 6 months ago I spoke with a guitar tech at a local music shop about mim strats and the benefits (i.e. similar quality to USA but lower cost), and since then I was positive that was what I wanted. A deep dive on reddit about MIM strats confirmed what he said. Also, my fender acoustic has a strat-type build and I love the way it plays, so I was hooked.

I looked on GC and the usual used sites and found multiple MIM strats for $500-600, which seemed a fair price based on my reading. However I am moving in June so I was going to hold off.

But I was browsing craigslist and saw a great deal on a 2002 MIM strat ($250), the catch being that it had some dings and dents and had actually been custom refinished as a result in a matte satin black. The owner said he refinished it in light of that damage because the original finish was chipped.

I got the guitar, it came with a strap and a gig bag for the $250, and it plays and sounds so great. The seller was clearly a guitar tinkerer and very skilled- he did all the work on the guitar. Other than the refinishing the rest of the stuff was all original. He was a great guy and very honest about everything with the guitar, and IMO priced it beyond fairly based on what it was.

I got it home and LOVE the way it sounds- night and day from my epiphone, and from a distance it looks like a black strat. But up close the dings are more evident, and the satin finish isn't perfect. My fiance said it was ""ugly"" lol.

I feel like I got a great deal, but wanted to post it! For comparison, I paid about $200 for my epiphone studio!

For the cosmetics, I figure worst case I can cover the thing with stickers, but I'm not there (yet).

I guess the question in the back of my mind is was it worth paying $300 more for a guitar without the ""dents"" with the $550 on GC, but I will instead invest it in upgrading my amp!"

guitar,"Strumming chords can be quite hard for beginners, so I wanted to make a discussion about good habits to keep in mind when trying to play smoothly. [I made a video over on YouTube about it,](https://youtu.be/nBAm5JYLaa0) however, are the main points if you would prefer the text version.


**1 Keep your hand moving**

This is really important! Let's say you have four beats in a bar, try and play each strong beat (Ie ‚Äì 1, 2, 3, 4) with downstrums, and any notes in-between those beats with an upstrum. This keeps your hand/arm moving which in turn can keep a smooth motion to your playing. [Here is a diagram to help.](https://imgur.com/a/UJb12M4)

Now try and do all of that with just down or upstrums, not only will it sound more rough, but it will likely cause a bit of pain after a while!


**2 Dynamics &amp; Accents**

Dynamics, AKA the change in volume, can add a professional touch to your chord progressions. Dynamics are often overlooked but add a ton of value to strumming. 

A good example of a piece with differing dynamics and accents is [‚ÄòYellow‚Äô by Coldplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKNxeF4KMsY). You can hear they are stressing some of the chords, which in turn makes it sound far more interesting.


**3 Palm mute &amp; Percussive Hits**

[Summer of 69‚Äô by Bryan Adams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFjjO_lhf9c) is a classic of Palm muting (As well as accents) during the introduction. The contrast in texture really makes the song come alive and makes, what I believe, to be one of the most iconic introductions to a song.


**4 Not playing all the notes in a chord, strum different parts**

We can achieve a more interesting texture and a more sophisticated sound by breaking up the chords when strumming. Some good examples are [‚ÄòSkinny Love‚Äô by Bon Iver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6xBYAI9gI) and [‚ÄòGrowing Sideways‚Äô by Noah Kahan.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWodDfNklg) 

In the first example Bon Iver uses the lower notes of a chord to start each bar then strums the rest of the chord straight after in a repeated rhythm. 


**5 ‚Äì Plectrum**

So this one is a personal preference so take what I say next with a pinch of salt! The thickness of a plectrum can not only change the sound, but also affect the dynamics and how you phrase what you‚Äôre playing. 
Having a thick plectrum could create more louder strumming (Not necessarily a bad thing!). Experiment with different thicknesses, find what works for you 


So those are my five tips. I have two more on the video if you would like to watch that. However I‚Äôm curious, do you have any tips that might achieve better/smoother strumming?"

guitar,"I have been playing for a few decades now, have multiple guitars, most of which cost less than $1000 including some lower range models such as an early 90's squier strat.  I have never had a problem with sharp fret ends making my playing uncomfortable.  I can feel and clearly see the differences in better rounded frets, but Ive never felt the difference when playing.  I often hear youtubers reviewing different guitars and that is often one of their chief complaints. Is it a difference in hand position/style of playing?  Do many of you struggle with sharp frets?"

Hi guys, I recently changed my own nut {insert nut joke here} on a Sire T7 with a Graphtech Tusq XL pre-cut nut. Everything went well but now my G string is buzzing on open note BUT only when hitting it really hard (ie nowhere near the strength I'd use when playing normally)

The other strings are perfectly fine, this is despite fret clearance being equal (if not higher) than my G string.

The question is: is a buzzing open note ALWAYS a symptom or should I leave it alone since it does not affect anything the way I play? Is this an acceptable tradeoff for excellent playability in the first frets?

guitar,"[https://imgur.com/a/Pdh2btZ](https://imgur.com/a/Pdh2btZ)

Hi everyone! I recently purchased a PRS S2 Studio, which is a model I wanted to get for years.  


Took the plunge because guitar prices have been rising like crazy in my country. (some models like Gibson and Fender went up 1,000 USD since last year)  


My main guitars are a Gibson Memphis es-339 and an Ibanez Prestige AZ in HSS.  


My Gibson is very comfortable to play standing up but its impossible to play the upper frets because the cutaways are too small you can't fit your hand in there. And, I really need single coil tones. My Ibanez is very comfortable to play sitting down and I love the sounds of the single coil pickups, but I much prefer a shorter scale length when standing up.  


One pro setup and a long guitar practice later, I can say the pros of the PRS are:  


* The S2 trem bridge is located more left of the guitar body, similar in location to a Gibson SG. I like my picking hand in that location, so thats great.
* The D-type single coil pickups CAN do the strat thing well, just gotta bump up the tone knob on my overdrive pedal for the sparkly clean tones.
* The pattern regular neck has a narrower nut width at 42mm, and you can really tell the difference. I find it much more comfortable.
* The guitar's upper fret access is about as good as a Gibson SG.
* The pattern regular neck is great. It has the shoulders of the Ibanez AZ neck profile but rounder in the back. I think most AZ players will find this neck profile comfortable.

The cons are:  


* The lacquer finish on the neck is very very sticky.
* The 10 inch radius on the PRS will never have as low action on the high frets as a 12 inch guitar without more fret buzz on the low frets :(
* I much prefer stainless steel frets for lead playing

And thats it! I'll probably re-fret it to stainless steel with 12 inch radius sometime in the future. My 339 is actually being re-fretted right now."

My thoughts to fix this would be to use a screw that is the next size up, or large enough to grab the wood on the inside of the body so that the Anchor plate doesn't slip, but I would also have to drill out the through hole on the Anchor plate as well and I don't have a whole lot of play to work with. I'm looking for any suggestions before going to the next size up as I don't have much experience with wood working in general. Could there be some kind of putty or adhesive that I could simply fill the hole, allow to harden, then re-drill the screw?

guitar,So I been looking for a electric guitar but Amps seem expensive and was wondering if there was a electric guitar that don‚Äôt need amps. And if someone knows where to find these please tell me.
guitar," Going to Japan next month and looking to pick up some used gear at a  couple preowned hardware shops that I've scoped out. Gonna try and grab some old classic  pedals, probably just a TS8 and maybe a HM2 if I can find them fairly  priced in good condition. Or some compressor, not really sure.  


I'm  also looking to go a little more digital outside of maybe some effects  pedals, what should I be on the lookout for? I really only messed with  amps and stuff before, so all I have for digital is the audio interface. Have no idea what else I could possibly need for digital playing, but I definitely see a lot of gear that I'm just straight up unfamiliar with. Primarily playing metal, prog if that matters on equipment choice."
guitar,"I‚Äôm looking to buy my first electric guitar, and I‚Äôm looking at a Donner DST-100 because I found one available used for $100 with a gig bag, some picks, a cable, a tuner, a capo and a mini amp (the listing says they‚Äôre included but I‚Äôm unsure about their condition, though it‚Äôs specified as being ‚Äúgood‚Äù). I‚Äôve seen some reviews online that basically all say ‚ÄúNot a great guitar but good as a first guitar‚Äù. Does anybody in this sub have experience with this instrument and/or it‚Äôs accessories and can verify that?"
guitar,"Yes I know there is a million threads on this. 

Got my first real strat with texmex pups. Was considering switching it out with either the SD psychedelic or the Fender 57/62. Not sure if there‚Äôs any real benefit to doing that. 

Just want something that does cleans well but will respond well to low/moderate gain. Appreciate any opinions."
guitar,"I know how to get feedback in general and use it quite a bit, but is there some kind of method or way to get it to sound like a specific note?"
guitar,"I currently have an opportunity to own one of these guitars, but I'm at a loss for which to choose. I want something versatile since I enjoy blues/jazz cleans and light overdrives, but I also like anything in the realm of alternative to somewhat harder rock stuff that's a little more overdriven (think like Arctic Monkeys, Paramore, Foo Fighters, Linkin Park).

Some of those artists might fit better under the humbucker category, but I'm just looking for something that can be like a Jack of all trades when it needs to be
- doesn't need to be perfect.

I see teles are often considered the most versatile guitar, but I also see a lot of people say P90s are some of the most versatile pickups. I'm on the fence and curious if a dual P90 guitar or telecaster checks the most boxes for you. I've already played them both and they're both awesome, so I'm not sure myself yet."

guitar,"I was looking for a looper but found the flamma fs01 drum machine and looper built into one. I thought this was so cool so decided to spend a bit extra for the drum machine built in. 

I have the Fender Mustang 1 amp. For those who don't know it has a lot of preset sounds, distortions and effects to use. Overall great amp for what I do. 

There is no clean guitar sound though with this amp. A preset sound is always on. 

Now that I'm thinking it, will the drum machine output also have that same distortion sound or effect I have selected through the amp? Or will it be smart enough somehow to not touch the drums coming through?

The guitar plugs into the flamma fs01 and then that plugs into the amp. So the distortion effects come after the loop and not before like a regular chain. 

I'm hoping it doesn't but I just wanted to make sure. Sorry hope this makes sense as well. 

Anyone with this amp plus a drum machine able to give some help? Complete noob when it comes to this but figured the flamma fs01 would really help take it to the next level for me."

guitar,"I am currently checking out a few different S type guitars and didn't *really* find something that ticks all my boxes. It doesn't have to be a Fender tbh, even though I love them and own a great Telecaster and used to own a 60s reissue.

I love vintage style Stratocasters in terms of design, shape and tone. The vintera series comes really close but some things throw me off. While I like a Vintage radius, I already have one with a 7.25"". The truss rod access not being on the headstock is also a bit annoying. I like to play around with my setup and always having to screw off the neck is suboptimal. I thought about getting a player strat and replace the pickups for vintage style ones, but I love a fat neck. Maybe not baseball bat, but not as thin as a modern C that's on the Player strats, they're too thin. That's my issue with the vintage modified series. They have 60s style PUPs but a modern neck which I dislike.

Are there any brands that offer guitars like this?? I have checked a few of the major brands but didn't find anything that's not either super expensive or not what I'm looking for.

I would love something along the lines of:
Thicker neck (maybe early to mid 60s style) and easy truss rod access at the headstock.
Pickups that sound like the 60s ones, imo they're warmer and have less sparkle. The fretboard radius doesn't matter as much but I would definitely prefer a 9.5"" because I already have a 7.25"" and think I would like a flatter one on my next S style.
I 100% prefer a Satin Neck but I could always sand down a glossy, poly or nitro finished neck. My hands get sticky when playing for a while. Fretboard wood is not super important. I prefer rosewood but I'm also used to playing maple on my teles.

I have seen a few used highway one strats but it's hard to find a lot of information about those. 
I own pretty much only fenders (not on purpose) and don't know much about other brands offerings currently. I heard a lot of them beat Fender in terms of quality and features (locking tuners on sub 1000‚Ç¨ guitars, nitro finish on some, cheaper price for better quality). 

Would be cool if anyone has some recommendations. A friend said FGN guitars are great but they are hard to find where I live and their S types only have HSS.

tldr: Looking for a Stratocaster/S Style guitar with a thicker neck (not the modern C that's on the player series), preferred 9.5"", satin neck finish would be nice and 60s style pickups SSS. Around 1000‚Ç¨ +/-
60s reissue fenders have a 7.25"" and the truss rod access is annoying. Vintage modified MIM have a neck shape I dislike. Not sure which models would suit me."

guitar," Hi all,

So I'm trying to learn guitar so I bought a cheap but well-reviewed started kit from Monoprice ([https://www.monoprice.com/product?p\_id=625904](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=625904)). I'm now on my third set, because the first two had problems with either the guitar or amp. Got the third one today, and once again something seems to be wrong.

I've verified that the amp powers on. When I turn all the knobs to the right without plugging in a lead, I get a soft hissing sound, which based on my research is a good sign. However, when I plug in the included lead cable, I get an incredibly loud buzzing sound. So much so that I need to turn down the knobs to around 1-2. This is without touching the tip of the lead or anything. I've uploaded a video of the sound here: [https://streamable.com/1x0qx9](https://streamable.com/1x0qx9)

The buzzing sound continues even when the guitar is plugged in. In addition, the two thickest strings sound very muddy when played. Does this indicate a bad lead cable or am I missing something? Is it time to try for set #4? Thanks for your help!"

guitar,After being a bedroom guitarist for the past few years I‚Äôve finally been able to start gigging so in preparation for what I thought was a big gig I bought a head and cab (4x12) for it.

guitar,"I'm 24, growing up I had always been to playing guitar, practicing guitar solos and impressing people that I can play the guitar solo of just about any song. I made my little breakthrough playing Canon Rock at age 13 on stage. And it's been great. But I soon lost that passion to do those stuff and the rest of my years have just been me doing.. absolutely nothing.

I blame myself for being blinded by cheap dopamine: video games, porn.. I feel like I've been sleeping this whole time. It's not like I lost interest in playing guitar. I heard a couple months ago, a song from Polyphia, I thought that was cool. Never seen anything like that before. So I contemplated if I should practice that, but then.. wouldn't I just be like, copying them?

I think the main problem is that I don't feel like I've established an identity.

I feel like everybody else got their own sound, AND their looks: they know their brand well.

Brian May, not only paired with his unique sound but because of his Red Special and that amazing Renaissance hair.

Tim Henson, known for his own style of playing as well, in terms of looks he always attracts the audience with his tattoos, he has that anime character charm.

Meanwhile me.. a very undecided genre of playing (sometimes playing rock solos, sometimes I sing acoustic songs, it's a whole wreck of it, even my audience is confused). And also my looks are inconsistent, don't have any charm/aura I reckon. I'm still trying to figure that out too.

guitar,"(*I'm kind of deliberatley trolling a little bit.  I LOVE gear, but I am starting to believe in the approach below..)*

This aesthetic is pervasive in YouTube videos, and even finds its way into the zoom background of recent colleagues.

I'm fully in favor of learning as much as you can about gear. Sometimes it takes owning one example of something to really learn about it.  E.G. you might not fully grasp the difference in output and noise rejection between single coil and dual coil pickups until you one of each.

However, in my own aquisitions, I have realized that it is useful not to embrace the aesthetic of piles of gear along the walls in my studio.  I generally keep what I have bought in the closet until I need it.  Making a simple, ergonomic, clean space over a gallery aesthetic a priority has subtly shaped the way I think about purchasing gear.   There's kind of a zero sum game there, something comes in, something goes out.

I have to constantly remind myself that a video that has Sweetwater as a sponsor is not representative of how mere-mortals should consume gear.  On many levels, it is just advertising.

I have never had this much difficulty when learning a new technique. I cant do it anywhere close to a moderate speed. My eventual goal is to get good enough to play the main riff of Teardrinker by Mastodon. I just cant understand how it is even possible to speed it up more than 80bpm quarter notes. 

Even at 80bpm feels as clumsy as when I tried vibrato for the first time.

guitar,"So recently i bought a used guitar (Ibanez RG921 WBB Premium  from 2015) and it played like a dream until i took on vacation without it for a few days . So when i came back from holiday i grabbed it and started playing like usual, but every time i stopped playing it would make a high pitched ringing sound that almost sounded like a form of reverb (without having any reverb turned up on the amp) only to fade away after about 0,5 - 2 seconds. It only happens on the bridge pickups, and sounds completely normal on the neck pikcup. I have tried tying a sock around the neck between the nut and tuners. It didn't help, the ringing noise was still there. It does not make a noticable sound when it's not plugged into an amp, and it only occurs on distorted channels. Now i'm concerned if something inside the bridge pickup may be broken or damaged or if this Ibanez series is known for having bad/easily breakable pickups?"

guitar,"So I'm trying to create a set up for live gigging, and I've come across a really strange issue... I feel a burning pain when I touch my guitar strings with anything other than my calloused fingertips. After some quick googling I discovered this was an issue with grounding somewhere in the signal chain, but I have no idea where.


My gear includes: Guitar (Line6 Variax), Interface (Focusrite Scarlett Solo), Midi foot controller (Behringer FCB1010) which runs into my laptop via a Roland USB MIDI interface, and practise monitors (Audio Technica entry level monitors).

The only things connected to a power source are the Behringer foot controller (3 pronged plug), and the Monitors (2 pronged plug).

I only experience the electrical burning when my bare foot is touching the metal body of the Behringer foot controller, at the same time that my arm is touching the strings. If I unplug either the foot controller, or the monitors, the electrical burning goes away. So I figure that my body is completing a circuit somehow between the 2 wall-powered components. I've tried using different sockets around my house but this hasn't changed anything. The Behringer foot controller is my newest piece of gear and this is when I first noticed the issue. But it's also the first time I've ever had 2 separated wall-powered components in my system so I'm not sure where the real problem is coming from.

I thought about getting my guitar serviced but I can't pinpoint if the guitar is the source of the problem or if it's something else such as the foot MIDI controller.

Sorry for the long read. Would anybody be able to point me in the right direction or give me advice? Any help would be appreciated :)"

But it's also the first time I've ever had 2 separated wall-powered components in my system so I'm not sure where the real problem is coming from.

I thought about getting my guitar serviced but I can't pinpoint if the guitar is the source of the problem or if it's something else such as the foot MIDI controller.

Would anybody be able to point me in the right direction or give me advice? Any help would be appreciated :)"
guitar,"Hi there!  
On July 27, 1954, Erroll Garner recorded the instrumental version of ""Misty,"" which was released on the Contrasts album. The song remained virtually unknown until it was popularized by Johnny Mathis in 1959; His album entered the charts on October 5 of that year and peaked at number twelve. This guitar cover is from the Barney Kessel concert in the channel Mezzo, which I'm trying to transcribe. I hope to transcribe the whole concert this year!

guitar,"So, idea is to connect guitar to interface, run Guitar Rig on PC and use it as amp/pedal emulator for live home practice, output will be my headphones. I never used audio interface device before, so I have couple of questions:

1. Is this kind of setup lag free, can it replace amp/pedal combo for home play?
2. Do I connect headphones to interface or to PC DAC? If I connect to interface, do I hear clear sound or do I hear effects for Guitar Rig? What about sound quality of interface headphone out, is it comparable to cheaper DAC, those it have enough punch? I suppose there is more lag if I use interface for input and my DAC/Sound card for output?
3. Is Kontrol 1 good choice for about 70 euros or should I invest 40e more for Scarlet Solo?"

guitar,I have a Hendriksen JazzAmp that suddenly started making crackling/popping sounds. At first I thought it was line noise from the guitar but it continued when I unplugged the guitar. Then it even continued faintly after I \*turned it off and then unplugged the power cord\*. So maybe there are capacitors involved somehow.
guitar,"Hey. I bought a Jackson RR3 back in the fall. It had some wiring issues. It's a HH with 2 volumes and 1 tone, with a 3 way toggle.

1. *Improper grounding (fixed)*
2. When I got it it had weird coupling of the volume and tone knobs. Rolling off the tone knob would also reduce the volume. In the middle position of the pickup toggle, all of the knobs would affect the volume and the tone did ""darken"" but it was very weird sounding.

*So, I have gotten the guitar to the state where both volume knobs work properly*. The hum from the improper grounding is gone. It sounds beautiful and clear, *but now my tone knob does absolutely nothing*.

*What are my options for the source of the problem?* Is the cap dead? Was the tone knob faulty to begin with, causing the volume/tone coupling? Or did I kill the knob somehow in my noob soldering adventure? It is confusing me because there was some sort of tone filtering going on when the wiring was completely messed up, but now that I think the wiring is correct it seems like it's a brick, which doesn't make sense to me.

The body is LP style with a natural wood finish and an arm carve. There are two knobs with an output jack below and a switch to the left, different from any LP I have seen. The neck says Gibson, but the inlays are dots, so I am doubting its authenticity. The neck itself is three-piece flamed maple, with a serial number and ""MADE IN USA"" on the back.

guitar,"Hey guys,

I have been playing 7 string guitars in either dropped A tuning or half step down dropped G# for about 12 years and the only reason I ended up playing in half step down is because my voice struggles a bit when I write vocals in standard tuning.

The point I‚Äôm trying to make is that I am only tuning down for practical purposes.

Ever since I started playing in half step down, I notice that power chords above the 5-6th fret are just impossible to get to be in tune for me. The low B string is almost always sharp or otherwise not stable when the string is struck/fretted. People call this pitch drift I believe. When I play those same power chords on the lower frets up to about the 4th fret it all sounds great and doesn‚Äôt tend to go sharp at all. 

Here‚Äôs what really bothers me‚Ä¶. My brother has an old dusty RGD7321 and even though the strings on there on probably 6-8 years old, the power chords above the 5th fret are almost perfect. I distinctly remember writing and recording with that guitar years ago and never having issues with power chords at any place on the neck, even the 12th fret. My brother uses lighter strings as well so my guess is that the strings on that guitar are either 10-56 or 10-59 and the brand is almost certainly D‚ÄôAddarrio due to the colored string ball ends. 

I‚Äôve had two guitars with Evertunes and I still get this issue while the 400 dollar RGD from 2011 with stock everything has better intonation above the 5th fret. My last guitar was a Jericho Fusion Walnut Evertune with 25.75‚Äù scale and I always had this issue no matter what strings I used, which is weird because the Evertune is meant to stop this pitch drift issue from ever happening. My current guitar is a PRS SVN 26.5‚Äù with Evertune and 10-56 strings.

I recently put on a set of Ernie Ball regular slinkies (10-56) and the issue almost went away completely. I was shocked because I always tried to use heavy strings to combat this issue and it always made it worse. I put the same gauge strings from Elixir and the issue is back again. 

How much of this issue can be attributed to the string gauge/brand, intonation setup, the nut, string height, and scale length? This issue has been haunting me for years. I am really dumb when it comes to guitar physics and setups. I just play the things lol

Thank you!!!

TLDR: What factors affect tuning issues with power chords above the 5th fret?"

guitar,"Hi all,

So I'm currently standing at a fork in the road about a potential trade for my Gibson B.B. King Lucille. I've had the Lucille since Dec. 2021, it was a dream guitar of mine for a long time. The Lucille is in fantastic shape. After a few days of having the guitar, I felt a little disappointed in the tone. It wasn't really at all what I envisioned B.B's tone to be (even through my 70's Twin Reverb). I know A LOT of tone comes from your fingers, but the pickups in the Lucille sound kind of sterile and it just doesn't play like I expected. With that being said, it's still a high quality and beautiful instrument that I planned on keeping for life, and it has sentimental value to me considering how much I admire BB.

I recently stumbled upon a '72 ES-335TD in Walnut. The guy is willing to do a straight trade. From what I read, this guitar would actually be more accurate to BB's Live at the Regal tones during his heyday. On top of that, I'm pretty sure financially it's worth more than my Lucille, anyway. Wondering what people's inputs are and which one is the superior instrument? I would definitely like to own a vintage ES but the Lucille has some sentimental meaning to me, despite being disappointed with the tone."

guitar,"Hi all,

I recently obtained a [EC-258](https://www.espguitars.com/products/20401-ec-258) and im really liking it so far. but the place i got it from sold it to me used and one of the machine heads ended up rusting off.

Because i bought it second hand its not under warranty and ESP won't send / sell / etc OEM parts for personal repair, on top of that i can't find 8 string specific machine heads, so i would need to buy at least 2 6 string sets and bore a hole in the 5th and 6th string heads to get them to proper gauge. 

am i SOL here or does anyone have some advice ?"

However, I'm at the point now where I'd like to purchase a loop switch. But I'm not sure what kind to get or if anything will even be compatible with the amp itself. 

The amp has a separate footswitch input which I can purchase a footswitch separately to change between two different presets. 

But I'd like a looper where I stomp on it, play like a 4 bar riff, press again and loops what I just played so I can practice playing over it like guitar solos.

guitar,"Hi All,

I‚Äôve written a guided practice manual for musicians that helps you organize, record and reflect on your practice over the course of a month, week and year. The target audience is anyone that's practicing 30+minutes a day consistently, or trying to.

If you move to fast from subject to subject and need focus, don't have a clear idea of how your practice is effecting your progression towards your goals or feel stuck in a rut - the journal should help. I use it to organize my practice and goals across four different instruments I gig on.

I‚Äôm in the testing and tweaking phase before I finalize the manuscript. It's in a ""printable"" form right now, because earlier testing phases with a digital product didn't work too well. There's a charm and ease to pen and paper.

The process is:  
You DM me, we talk briefly, I collect your email.

I'll send you an NDA.

Once you sign the NDA, you'll be invited to join a group session with other product testers where we all fill out the initial steps of the journal together (I'll send you a printable copy a couple minutes beforehand). I'll be there to answer questions, give you practice/exercise tips and collect your honest feedback.

After that, the journal is yours. I'll touch base with you over the course of the month to see how your practice is coming along and whether the journal is still helpful. In it's current form, the book only lasts for a month - but if you're still using it I'll keep providing you updated copies until the product actually launches (well \*if\* it launches).

Thanks, please feel free to ask questions."

guitar,"I got a Focusrite solo for playing guitar directly on my PC for playing on calls and streams and such without the horrible quality of a microphone, but i can only play with a clean sound.

The combo amp i used before has an overdrive that sounds nice, but it has no output jack, meaning i can't send that through my interface as far as i'm aware.

I was messing around and trying to install plugins to play with, but either the installation process was impossible (Stuff just freezing or not installing), or the delay is so long the sound reaches my ears almost a full second after i actually play it. Plus the ridiculous amount of software needed to just play guitar with an amp simulation is awful, so i decided to give up on using virtual effects for now.

Is there a way i can use my amp's headphone out jack to plug into my audio interface, or do i need to buy something like an amp head or even just an effect pedal?

I can't find help with this anywhere because everyone only talks about **recording** guitar, but not just **playing** guitar directly for the sake of.. you know.. playing guitar.

I know i can use my amp to do that, but the ease of just picking up your guitar and playing with the option of letting others hear you over the internet - without having to reseat yourself, unplug your headphones from your PC, plug them into your amp, and then start playing only to yourself - is a luxury i'm willing to spend some time on.

I need some tips on how I should go about to learn the basics, I guess...
I've been ""playing"" for 15 years (haven't really played that much for the past 10), mostly rock/blues/metal.
My learning path consisted solely from playing by ear and learning tabs with Guitar Pro on PC.
I've gotten to the point where I could play really difficult pieces almost 1-to-1 (Satriani, Vai, Buckethead, etc.).

But during my entire ""career"" as a guitar player, I have found myself trying to jam with friends/to some instrumentals and I was simply not able to.
A friend would tell me for example ""let's do chord1 chord2 chord3"". He'd start playing the rythm and I would just stand there with a dumb look on my face haha.
I do know the basic chords (I'm talking C, D, G, etc. lol), but that is simply not enough so that I could go to a jam session and have fun with people.
I really haven't done myself a favor with the way I learned to play.

I would really appreciate your input here r/Guitar.

I  like blues and blues-based rock, so the ability to bend that string is  important.

guitar,"As the title suggests, I'm looking into getting a new guitar. I bought my current Epiphone Les Paul heavily used a few years back, and I'm not super happy with how it plays anymore.

Initially I was put off by Teles because I always associated them with only playing country music, but from what I've seen in other discussions on here, Teles seem to generally be the more versatile instrument compared to Strats. The genre I'm most interested in playing is alternative/indie rock, so anything with versatility is appealing to me. Also the heavier body of the Tele feels a bit more natural to me, probably because I'm used to playing on a Les Paul.

I've also seen a few comments saying that Jazzmasters offer the best of both worlds, but I don't really know how they compare to the other models.

guitar,"Hi all, 

Just wanted to stress how important it is to set yourself up for a successful practice session by creating/ utilizing a good work station with a few tips below. Most people focus on WHAT to learn and practice but don‚Äôt put enough emphasis on creating a good environment that allows them to learn and practice in an optimal state. Here are some tips to creating an ideal workstation to practice that have really helped me. 

1.	If you have access to a desk/workstation with a computer (and preferably a second monitor), grab a good chair and play in front of your work station! It‚Äôs easy for us to want to practice on the couch or our beds, but in doing so, it can be a pain to easily look up lessons, questions, etc. I used to just use my phone or tablet to learn but I had to constantly switch apps and such to pause/play the song, switch back to the tab, etc. By having a computer/laptop, especially with a second monitor right in front of you, you can pull up lyrics to songs in one tab/screen, the chords/tabs in another, and have something like Spotify pulled up to listen to the song as well, all right in front of you without having to switch back and forth. You can also easily Google any question you have about theory or whatever as well. This alone has allowed me to progress a million times faster in my learning. Second monitors are quite cheap now a days as well. 
2.	Get a loop pedal and keep it next to you and plugged in at all times. I used to clean mine up to clear space/get the cables out of the way, but then I wouldn‚Äôt plug it back in out of laziness, and half the time I‚Äôd never even use it. Do whatever you can (cable management, zip ties, etc) to keep it plugged in and ready to go when you sit down. 
3.	Get a footstool on Amazon or wherever for $10-15 and put the guitar on your off leg in an upright position. This will not only help your technique but will force you to sit upright and keep you alert/from slouching in practice. 
4.	Record yourself. Use your computer webcam if you have a workstation as noted above or buy a cheap phone stand on Amazon to be able to record yourself. This will help you realize where you‚Äôre falling short. 
5.	Don‚Äôt stress too hard about trying to divide up your practice into such a rigid routine. Pick a song you like and research the chords, solos, etc behind it. If the song has a ‚ÄúG chord‚Äù, don‚Äôt just memorize the shape, Google what makes a G chord (this is where practicing in front of a computer makes these simple searches super quick and easy). If you‚Äôre learning a solo, try to figure out how it fits into a certain scale or what they‚Äôre doing musically. 
6.	LEARN FULL SONGS and try to sing them as well. It‚Äôs so easy to just jump from one thing to the next when you‚Äôre not in a band or having to perform in front of others but by learning full songs, you will build all the blocks you need to perform as whole. It‚Äôs very embarrassing to have played for years, knowing tons of half songs, random solos, etc, but no full songs. Learning full songs is easy when you have a good workstation as well! 

I completely understand that not everyone may have the space or means to build a workstation like that, but if you are on the fence about it, trust me, it‚Äôs worth the investment. Good luck practicing everyone!"

When it comes to play arpeggios i am not good with the finger position, like keeping the spahe in left hand and only play right hand, but i try...

LOL my post got locked for no reason, so here we go again.

Hey guys,

1.5/2y ago I bought myself a nice epiphone les paul studio and fell in love with electric guitars. I‚Äôve been practicing consistently 1-1.5h per day ever since and have improved massively. I‚Äôm now trying to progress towards more of a virtuoso/shredding kind of playing.

I‚Äôm looking to buy a second guitar that can serve me well together with the epiphone and that can last for a long time. Budget is 2000‚Ç¨. I want something with a whammy bar since I don‚Äôt currently have it, and maybe a bit of a heavier character compared to my epiphone while still being flexible as I do like to play clean sometimes. I‚Äôm also in need for something with a flatter neck and easier access to higher frets since this is one pain point currently getting in my way of playing faster and faster. I‚Äôm mostly gonna use the new guitar for leads/soloing, and keep the epiphone for rhythm.

There are three guitars which have caught my attention and I‚Äôm now not sure which one would serve me best considering I‚Äôm not planning to buy another guitar for a long time. So here‚Äôs where I need some advice!

The guitars are:

- Ibanez RG60ALS: features I really like are the aesthetics (that colour rocks), the sustainiac (!) and the wizard neck. What is a bit annoying is it seems to be almost discountinued/hard to find somehow.

- Ibanez RG622XH: I‚Äôm so attracted to those 27 frets and I do like the coil splitting feature. Plus the flat neck and the manufacture in Japan, which is always a plus. But sadly no sustainiac, and I‚Äôm wondering if this is a big loss.

- Schecter C1- FR S SLS Evil Twin: I‚Äôve been rather fascinated with schecter guitars, and they do seem to have the gritty character I‚Äôm missing rn. Sustainiac check and good price/quality ratio. Neck isn‚Äôt as flat as Ibanez, and talking in some music stores etc. I‚Äôve been told I should really go to Ibanez if I want a shred machine that lasts and is still versatile.

I‚Äôd like to get a bit of an unbiased opinion, since I like all three and frankly would buy them all if I could hahah.

I hope I was clear, sorry for the wordy post guys!! HELPPPPP"
guitar,"I want to jam with random people online, I feel like it's gonna be fun. Is there anything similar to Omegle but for musicians?"
guitar,"Can you help me decide between these two, I cant decide. I am worried about charvel having a thinner tone and I am worried about les paul not being to pull of twangy sound like darkwave chorus+reverb type tones. Cant try any of these because there are no stores near."
guitar,"Anyone know if any of the Tone Vise pitch shifters will fit an Ibanez Lo-Pro Edge trem? I read that the edge model doesn‚Äôt fit the Lo-Pro. Anyone know if the Gotoh version does? 

Plus, what‚Äôs the best trem stabiliser to use with the pitch shifter? Needs to allow dive bombs and pull ups. I can live without flutters (although I will miss them. Lol). 

All advice appreciated. 

Many thanks."

guitar,"Good afternoon.  


I recently bought an audio interface from aliexpress because it basically was the best I could afford. I connected it to my computer, then plugged my guitar and headphones in and boom, no driver to be seen. I found a driver in an old youtube video after loads of research and finally got it ""working"". The audio from my computer is being output to my headphones, my guitar and microphone signal is detected by windows (by the same input but wtv), everything seems fine. However, when I use my DAW (Reaper) or the GR6 standalone, no audio from my guitar or microphone can be heard. Discord and the windows ""listen to yourself"" option work just fine.

guitar,"I have both amps, and I recently ran a metalzone pedal through both to hear their tones. The orange amp sounds 100x better than the marshall. It feels like there‚Äôs more drive in the sound, and much more in your face, while the marshall sounds muddier and not really present. 

I‚Äôve tried messing with both the pedal and marshall EQ, but still doesn‚Äôt sound anywhere as good as the orange amp. Is this strange, considering the Marshall has a bigger speaker and costs over $100 more?"
guitar,"I have been playing guitar for about 10 years now. However, I am a very casual player and haven't taken my Guitar skills to the proper Pro level. I am a singer and so I play rhythm guitar very well. That in itself is the main purpose of having learnt guitar, so that I can play it while singing. I have tried learning lead guitar along the way but I don't enjoy it as much. I mostly stick to chords. 

I've been using a cheap $100 guitar all these years and finally want to upgrade to a better guitar in the $400-$500 price range. ***Since my main usage is rhythm and chords play, I prefer a loud, clean and crisp sounding guitar rather than a softer and mellow tone.*** I have done a bit of research online but I'm just posting this here hoping to get better suggestions.

How do you decide if it's worth it?

Hey guys,

I've been playing guitar as a self-learner for about 4 years now. The first two years I had a rather random routine and learned playing on classical (a 30y old guitar I found in my attic) and acoustic guitars, mostly rhythm parts and fingerpicking leads.

Since 1.5/2y I've been playing exclusively electric guitar. I bought myself a nice epiphone les paul studio and a fender mustang LT-25 amp. I've been practicing consistently 1-1.5h per day and I've improved massively. I've learned tons of songs and solos closer to my area of general liking (hard rock, melodic metal, symphonic metal, etc.) and I'm now trying to progress towards more of a virtuoso/shredding kind of playing. Improv routines and music writing are on my radar in the foreseeable future. I'm not planning to play gigs live as I'm doing this purely for myself, and I live in Switzerland where we must live in a silent state resembling that of a convent, so my amp has been serving me well with lots of presets and a rather good sound in headphones.

I'm now looking to buy a second guitar that can serve me well together with the epiphone and that can last for a long time. Budget is 2000‚Ç¨. I want something with a whammy bar since I don't currently have it, and maybe a bit of a heavier character compared to my epiphone while still being flexible as I do like to play clean sometimes. I'm also in need for something with a flatter neck and easier access to higher frets since this is one pain point currently getting in my way of playing faster and faster. Doesn't necessarily have to be through-neck, bolt on is fine. I'm mostly gonna use the new guitar for leads/soloing, and keep the epiphone for rhythm.

There are three guitars which have caught my attention and I'm now not sure which one would serve me best considering I'm not planning to buy another guitar for a long time. So here's where I need some advice!

guitar,"Hey all!  New here, and not much of a poster, but can't seem to find what I'm looking for by searching.  Recent owner of an Ibanez RG series guitar, and this is my first foray into floating bridges (been a hardtail/TOM guy my whole life).  Just wondering how string changes work.

Easiest way would be to change one at a time so that the tension and all that is unaffected.  They'll be times where the guitar will need some TLC and I'll need to take them all out.  Would I need to block the trem before doing that?  And what do I use to block it?

Pretty sure Strat-style bridges, and the one in the JP15 kinda blocks it for you, but Floyd style ones you need to block it.  Just don't know about the Ibanez ones.

Thanks!"
guitar,"I have an old Fender guitar which never uses amp, and when I tested today there is no sound out. (The amp can cable works fine with other electric guitar).

Battery works too. Build-in tuner works. And I turned the tuner off when I tested with the amp.

I remembered I used to use sandpaper to lower the pickup heights and wonder if that the reason that no sound coming out of the amp. 

Could this be possible? Or is it just an old guitar so it just broken?

Please advise."
guitar,"Most forum articles and debate talk compare low output and high output pickups, and for most people this decision is pretty clear depending on the type of music they play. However, I'm curious as to what factors one would consider when deciding between low and medium output pickups.

I was able to get my hands on an Aria pro 2 rs-850, but I‚Äôm having some issues with it.

guitar,"My Orange Crush Mini amp has this weird squealing noise when it's plugged into the socket. The noise is there even when the volume is on 0 and I'm sure it's not the speaker's problem because the noise is still present even on the headphone output. I used to use a 1000mAh adaptor, it was good enough for practice and it wasn't that loud but i decided i want to record music with this amplifier and that's when I bought a 500mAh adaptor (what the amp actually needs) thinking this would solve the issue but it arrived earlier and its still there just in a different pitch. The noise only seems to go away when it's using the battery to power it. BTW I've tried using a noise gate for it but it still can be heard."
guitar,hey friends so what resources or videos or just anything would you suggest for someone looking to play metal that isnt just shredding modes up and down over and over.  Im at an intermediate level im just looking to focus on a style of music.
guitar,"So I played a gig last night, the person who played after me ended up playing an Olsen acoustic. It sounded really nice and looked cool so I checked online how much they are going for. The site states nine month waiting list and $30000‚Ä¶. I mean it‚Äôs a fantastic looking and sounding instrument, and I understand it‚Äôs a hand made instrument from a luthier at the top of his game, but if it sounded 30% better than my all solid Ibanez Artwood that would be a lot.

Which made me think where is the value line with guitars? At what point do diminishing returns really kick in? I love, have owned and justified buying a lot of expensive guitars, and this question isn‚Äôt to say that expensive guitars aren‚Äôt worth it, cause if you want them, can afford them and enjoy them then you do you, but with the quality of instrument builders world wide we‚Äôre getting seriously impressive instruments at reasonable prices. If it has a bigger brand name sure they‚Äôre a bit more, but still you can get great guitars that don‚Äôt cost the earth

So in mind with acoustic guitars spending more than $1500 you star getting massive diminishing returns and for electrics I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs closer to $1000.  

Where‚Äôs the value line in your opinion?"

Like you‚Äôre playing something where you can‚Äôt use your index finger on the lower strings to stop them from ringing out like if you‚Äôre doing a run that involves your index finger to be somewhere else leaving some strings exposed or you‚Äôre playing a bend and your fingers aren‚Äôt laying on the strings below or doing hammer-ons and pull offs with the open strings. Like I do this one exercise on the fret board where I play one fret and the next string I play the fret above the one I just played on the previous string, and so on till I reach my pinkie on the 3rd string and then I go down frets, and continue up the board going up and down. I can‚Äôt mute that cause my index finger is doing other things. I know that‚Äôs an exercise but it happens when playing too.

guitar,"To people experienced with both or either - what do you consider the pros and/or cons of either approach (or do you go with both)?  It seems to me that the main benefit of the all-in-one effects pedals are a) cost and b) convenience.  You just have to plug one thing into the wall, and it takes up less space.

OTOH, when I see most gigging guitar players, they have a whole floorboard of individual effects pedals.  The downsides there seem to me to be keeping them all together and getting power to each one (they all seem to need 9V separately).  I guess the upside is that you can change your tone on the fly and maybe there are some effects that you can't achieve with multi-effects boards?  (And then there's the Kemper that seems to be a cross between an effects pedal and an amplifier).

If you went one way or the other, would you have changed it?"

guitar,"I‚Äôve been playing the Alvarez RD26CESB for quite some time now and I love this guitar. I‚Äôve bought a few guitars since then but they just don‚Äôt feel the same as this one does, and I believe it‚Äôs because of how heavy (not in the metal kinda way, but it has a lot of bass to it) it sounds. I really enjoy deep open tunings like DADGAD, and I want to expand on this concept and find something that can really push that bassy heavy full tone. I‚Äôm considering an 8 string, because I‚Äôve heard they help with that kind of tone, but I‚Äôve never played one before so I‚Äôm not sure. I do know that I prefer the dreadnoughts over concert, so anything like that is preferable. Any recommendations?"
guitar,"I am experiencing an issue where my 1st string on my electric guitar sounds great with a fuzz pedal up until about the 12th fret, and then after that the fuzz has no affect. Only way around it is to go to my 2nd string ,and work my way down the fret board very low so I can get that high note with the fuzz.

Could this be a problem with the pickup or is it the fuzz pedal (I'm using the Big Muff pedal)? This is not a problem when the fuzz is off, so I don't think it's the pickup. Anyone experience this issue?"

I figure there is a difference in tension that may affect the neck, but do you think I could get away with skipping getting is re-set up? I'm getting it from Sweetwater so they're obviously gonna do a thorough inspection, but I am trying to decide if I really need the set up service for these string gauges since they charge another $100 for that.

guitar,"I got an ESP LTD electric guitar a few years ago and just started playing it again recently. I noticed it was severely out of tune, so yesterday I took it to Guitar Center and a technician there tuned it back up for me with a key.

Fast forward to today, I did some squeals with the whammy bar today and noticed the D string got slightly out of tune each time. I kept having to retune it on the fine tuner.

I mostly play blues/rock stuff (my top 3 guitarists are John Mayer, Jimi Hendrix, SRV)

I have been looking at getting either a fuzz (fuzz face) or a transparent od (klon or bluesbreaker clone). I was also considering fully upgrading the guitar.

guitar,"Back in January I signed up for a local Band in a Hat show.

If you don't know (or don't want to look it up :) ), there are multiple categories; vocals, drums, bass, strings, percussion, mixer, stage hands, and probably a few more. You sign up to participate based on what you play. For example I signed up for strings being I occasionally play guitar :)

At the drawing, the organizer(s) builds a band by pulling a name out of each ""hat"". Then you have 6 weeks to put together a 30-45 minute set.

It's been pretty interesting. Five guys who have never met, have different tastes, and even experience levels, working on a handful of songs. We each suggested a song we already know and the others then work on learning the song.

It's been a lesson to me as I tend to want to play the song. This is more of a, quick, learn the basic chords and fake it as best as you can. Cut the complicated stuff down to 3 or 4 chords. I didn't realize how hard that was though, especially 7 or 8 songs in a few weeks.

Set list (not in order yet but in order of what we pretty much have ready):

* I'm Bored - Iggy Pop
* Come Out And Play - The Offspring (my suggestion)
* Rockin' Is Ma Business - The Four Horsemen
* All Night Long - Lionel Richie
* A mashup of 7 Nation Army and Sweet Dreams
* Rebel Yell - Billy Idol
* Roxanne - The Police (this one has like 20 chord changes!)
* Guns of Brixton - The Clash (we're still thinking on this one).

3. I want to achieve a strat-ish quack on positions 2 and 4, would you recommend using the medium (8.8kŒ©) or low (6.2kŒ©) output strat pickup to achieve this? Is there any implication from picking a middle pickup that has a different output than the neck pickup?

guitar,"Hey all! I recently bought myself an Epiphone Les Paul. It's a really nice guitar and I really enjoy playing it, but I came here for some pickup upgrade advice. Truth be told, I know how to dial in good tones and know what sounds I'm chasing for, but I am not very good at guitar specifications and such. What I want is a very Gibson-sounding sort of pickup that can handle higher-gain stuff for thrash, death and black metal respectively. I play a lot of stoner and doom at the moment, but I combine all of these styles together occasionally and am looking for something flexible that sounds very Gibson-like. When I say Gibson, I mean a very hot pickup that sounds dark, or a very colorful and vibrant sounding pickup.

guitar,"Hello all! 

I was wondering what thoughts ye might have on some variations of open c tuning there are, and the various pros and cons of each. 

1) CGCGCE (from the Fender website) Personally I wouldn‚Äôt opt for this one due to the extra tension on the (what is usually the) B string. 

2) CGCEGC (as seen in a Sean Daniels vid on YT) this one seems convenient because of the major triad that‚Äôs right there in the middle. 

3) CGCFCE (seen in various places, with frequent mentions of Nick Drake - Pink Moon) this one seems nice, as someone who enjoys playing in DADGAD. But the only major 3rd being the high e makes me feel like it might be less enjoyable than a tuning with a slightly lower option like number 2 above. 

4) CGCEGD (doesn‚Äôt seem super common) I like this one for the easily available major triad, and the option to play the sus2 chord in the same fret. 

What‚Äôs your pick?"

I have used Justing Guitar on YouTube and find that a good source for learning specific songs. However, how would you go about getting back into guitar? Do I go back to basics, if so, which ones? Do I just start learning different songs?

My issue is, I have no idea what to do. I understand that I need to learn songs to get better, but the hurdles I'm facing when trying to learn a song are as follows:

Find the song: This is what I spend like 90% of my time on. I can't find songs I want to learn. Don't get me wrong, I have tons of songs I love that have good guitar parts in them, but when it comes to learning, I just can't find a song.

Find the dedication to go through the hardships of the song: I quit songs constantly and can't seem to face the hard parts. I only enjoy what I can already play, which makes it hard to progress.

Still don't know how to learn songs: For the longest time I watched a youtube guitar lesson channel named James James (also known as privettricker), he sadly quit a year ago and while he still has a huge archive, I find myself forgetting the songs after watching his videos. The way I learned was just watch the video and try to play along. So, I need a new way of learning new songs.

In summary, I've been playing for a long time, but have the skill of someone who's been playing for a few months, and need some advice going forward. I feel like I've wasted all my time playing really simple songs and not pushing myself to get better.

But it mostly just sounds like we are just droning the same chords over and over. With 3 guitars just wailing at the same time it doesnt really leave much ""space"" to stand out.

Is there a way to have more structured jam sessions that are more interesting with people I dont typically play with? We aren't really a band so I don't think anyone ever shows up with a song in mind to play. It's just like ""hey play something over this"" and then it just feels like I'm playing a few scale runs over some chords. I wish the music was more riff based honestly but don't know how to approach things that way. Any advice?"

guitar,I have been playing guitar for 6 years and no matter how much time I practice with a metronome or what. My bottle neck for picking speed is picking triplets between strings. I simply can not do it and it makes me want to throw my guitar across the room. I am talking specifically the motion where you are picking between the two strings not around the strings if that makes sense. So if I am picking between the b and high e string the pattern would be Up stroke on the b string down stroke on the e then up stroke on the b again. Also the other way around so down on e up on b and down on e again. This has been a problem for me for years. I am so frustrated by it. I will sit there with a metronome going for hours just picking between the strings and no matter what I can not get it to a respectable speed before I end up hitting the same string twice on accident or completely miss the string. If anyone has any advice on this id greatly appreciate it. Thank you.

I‚Äôve got my 7-string bridge action perfect which has just the right amount of looseness for chugging. This is around 1.6-1.7mm as recommended by many, measured at fret 17 with a capo on fret 1

However when I play muted bar chords upwards of frets 9 or 10, it starts to sound dead unless I palm mute really close to the bridge. It‚Äôs like the strings become suffocated, clacking on the frets just after

I added more neck relief (neck bow) by loosening the truss rod and this seems to have helped, with the deadness moving further up the neck where I rarely palm mute. However it‚Äôs still slightly there at 12 and my truss rod is already quite loose. I really don‚Äôt want to raise my bridge action and my string gauge is perfect (.60). 

Is it possible that over-bowing the neck has had an adverse effect where it‚Äôs actually having a raising effect on the high frets? Should I be chasing a less bowed neck?

Any help is much appreciated"

I bought this second hand fender stratocaster classic player 60s some time ago. I tested it and though the tone pots didn't do shit I was quite happy with the straty tones, the playability and the general look of it so I did not consider it a major issue and thought I'll take a look at it when I'll change the strings. 
Damn I was now the owner of a strat, the birds were supposed to sing louder and the sun to shine brighter. 
Today I removed the strings, the pickguard and I was expecting to do some soldering and maybe even change a pot or two but here is the scam I guess. 
The screws are not in front of the proper holes in the body, the pots are 500k (isn't 250k pots the standard in a strat?), the selector switch has 8 in line leads instead of the 4/4 fender type, there is no clear inscription on the neck joint or the pickups.
The serial number on the headstock seem to indicate a classic player 60s on the fender website but I have doubts about the authenticity of any other part. 
I looked at wiring diagrams online and did some soldering, put everything back in place and the tone knobs do change the tone now but it's quite subtle. Is it because it's 500k pots instead of 250k?
What are your thoughts? Was I scammed hard ? Also what is the round cavity for? 
Thanks you all for your time."

guitar,"Recently, I‚Äôve been getting heavily back into guitar after taking a break and primarily playing drums in band/studio environments and occasionally bass. During this time, I stored my Greg Bennett Torino that I‚Äôve used for the past 16-17 years at my parents house for about a year and a half. Here recently I went to pick up the guitar only to find it‚Äôs been knocked over and moved around to a garage area and now the neck joint is separating.

Either one I‚Äôm replacing the pickups with a Seymour Duncan Phat cat in the bridge and Seth Lover in the neck from my Torino so I‚Äôm more so concerned with playability and over quality as opposed to sound.

guitar,"No, I did not get a real '59 Burst. That would be insane! But I did splurge on a used 2018 Gibson Custom Shop Historic '59 Les Paul Reissue. It wasn't cheap but it was exponentially more affordable than the real thing. I just started learning about the history of the Bursts last year. Their history, what makes them special, how the materials differ from modern day LPs. Which led me to learning about these reissues and how they're goal is to recreate that original magic. I still don't know too much about the difference between True Historic vs Historic vs Non-Historic Custom Shop. One thing I constantly heard was that you have to play it before you buy it because they could be hit or miss. Or just not connect with you. I was able to get my hands on an a few R8's and R9's locally. The R8 I tried really did have that baseball bat neck. The R9 that I tried was good but I couldn't go along with the lemon burst. I also got to try a real Tom Murphy aged R0. It was beautiful. And also $12,000.

I ended up saving a few used listings from Chicago Music Exchange. I had to wait for a hobbies stipend from my job to kick in before I could pull the trigger and many of the ones I have saved were getting snatched up. When I was finally eligible, I didn't want this one to get away so took it as soon as I could. It's a gamble buying a Les Paul without playing it but this really paid off. This guitar sounded so good before I even plugged it in. It just resonates so well. It's way more comfortable to play than my Les Paul Standard that I bought last year (still love it). I heard they save the lightest mahogany for these CS reissues and it really makes this guitar feel balanced. The unpotted pickups give so much warmth and bite when you need one or the other. I love tapping them with my pick to hear how microphonic they are. Overall, this is a gem of a guitar and I couldn't be more impressed by it.

guitar,"So ive been playing for 10 years, i sing too. But I've got a Gig coming up and ill have to play for 3, or 3 and a half hours straight almost.
So the thing is, normally i practice for a 30 min or maybe an hour but i stop after roughly an hour becouse my fingers just pain too much. I dont know how i will make 3 without stopping. The gig is in 3 weeks so i need to get these fingers hard and sharp before. Please help me?"
guitar,"I see a lot of posts about people wanting to know why their soloing or improvising isnt any good, even though they know scales, chords and arpeggios. I dont know much about theory, reading, or writing music. But I can improvise over pretty much anything, I have zero trouble finding the right notes and soloing. This isnt even my opinion, Ive had people say they really like what I play. So I know Im at least hitting the right notes that go with whatever Im jamming to. Call it a natural talent? I cant explain it, but maybe thats what it is?

Ive always thought that maybe I should advance my playing- Im 100% self taught on guitar, but I took bass lessons in the late 90s. Basically, if I hear it, I can probably play it. I know this might not be true for a lot of players, and they may need tabs or sheet music. I can read tabs but thats it. I know basic chord shapes (I think!) But really its as though Im making it up as I go along, like Im juuust good enough to get by.

My fear is, that by learning stuff like theory, that I might be putting myself inside a box, i.e. lose my artistic *freedom.* Newfound ""rules"" that might hinder my expression. I wonder about those who *do* know theory or can read and write, and how maybe they feel the opposite way I do. Did they put themselves in a box unintentionally? Think about English or Grammer class. You were taught where to put the comma, semi colon, adjectives, etc.

I cant remember who said it or where I read it, but I know I saw someone say that learning the ""rules"" or theory or whatever, kind of dampened their ability to improvise. 

I asked a couple people and got mixed answers. One said that learning more could only open up new avenues. Another sort of agreed with me, but neither play. I dont have many peers in guitar, so I figured Id reach out here to see what others might think. 

Bonus: I view music as a language. It can be written, and spoken. It can be felt and mundane. It can be read, and performed. Theres no right or wrong, until you introduce theory(?) You can speak a language without knowing how to read or write it. And vise versa. Theres ebonics, phonics, grammar and slang. Tons of genres, styles, techniques. Its infinite. Sometimes though, its definite, or right or wrong. Polished. Music can be anything. Music is art, music is expression. Music is also math, and can follow a precise formula, while other times its random and unique. Ear of the beholder. 

I look forward to what strangers from all over the world think of this, as I dont see it discussed often, if ever.

I (guitar student at Musician‚Äôs Institute) recently purchased the [Boss WAZA Air](https://www.boss.info/us/products/waza-air/) system and love it so much that I want to share a couple of ways I have it integrated into my practice regimen.

BWA comes with headphones and a guitar input, BOTH must be charged separately.

Next, the [BWA app must be downloaded](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bts-for-waza-air/id1475728751) to your smartphone or tablet.

**Note, there are 2 Bluetooth channels** AUDIO plays your device‚Äôs backing tracks through the headphones, while MIDI links to your BWA settings. To play backing tracks, make sure you are connected to the BT called ‚ÄúWAZA-Air AUDIO‚Äù (both can be connected simultaneously).

When music reading is required, I link my iPad to a 24‚Äù tv via HDMI, which allows the audio to still be streamed via BT to my headphones.

Two ways I use BWA for practice reading:

1. BWA + Sight Reading Factory: with this setup, I use SRF to create reading exercises that appear on my tv and with the audio through my wireless BWA.

2. BWA + Hal Leonard books with online audio tracks: with this setup, I split my iPad screen to show (L) Hal Leonard audio tracks (Google chrome browser) and (R) the corresponding book &amp; licks (Google drive).

For me, BOSS WAZA Air not only eliminated pesky cords, but led to me having more productive practice sessions and less wasted time. You can plug and play literally anywhere without bothering a soul. Highly recommended."

Now having learnt the cause being my odd anatomy in the form of really long nail beds, I'm wondering how people deal with it? Surely there are other players out there with this ailment.

Just to be clear, by 'long nail beds' I mean if the nail is cut to shortest possible (limited by pain/bleeding from the nailbed), then when pressing on the string at 90degree angle the nail would first hit the fretboard. This in turn means the fingertip needs to be angled in relation to the fretboard, which brings the soft finger padding closer to the neighboring strings sometimes touching them. And this change in angle introduces the inadvertent muting of said strings.

Are there specific kinds of guitars or any modifications that could help players in this situation?"

guitar,"I started playing guitar as soon as I started high school and played it throughout. I got an A in every music exam I sat up until the highest level qualification they could give me. I‚Äôve not long graduated but for the last year or two I‚Äôve been in a serious rut. 

I‚Äôve Basically learned that I never REALLY studied the guitar as an instrument. I just learned songs. Fairly Difficult songs. My physical technique is relatively good. I don‚Äôt struggle with chords or barre chords, I‚Äôm pretty good at finger style. I can‚Äôt play SUPER fast but shredding isn‚Äôt really my thing so that doesn‚Äôt bother me. We also had to study music theory so I have at the very least a basic knowledge of scales, chord construction, intervals and all that. 

I‚Äôve found recently that I don‚Äôt know how to use what I know. For instance, I know the pentatonic boxes, the caged system and triads. But I can‚Äôt use them. I‚Äôm inspired by jam bands from the 70s, so my ultimate goal is improvisation but I don‚Äôt know what to do next. I have no ear training. I mean I can tell when I‚Äôm hitting a root note for example but that‚Äôs easy - it‚Äôs quite obvious. 

I can‚Äôt seem to find much help that‚Äôs of use for my situation. Everyone just teaches the pentatonic positions or something like that when I already know that. I suppose it‚Äôs musicianship I have zero experience with. I know how to handle a guitar, but for the improvisation I‚Äôd need to properly understand the instrument and have trained my ears. Getting a personal teacher is not really within my realm however I am more than prepared to pay say monthly for some sort of online structured curriculum. I am well aware that YouTube has a lesson on everything, however I think you need to know what to look for to get much out of it. And I don‚Äôt. Otherwise it‚Äôs just overwhelming. 

So if anyone has any help, pointers or knows of any online curriculums it would be greatly appreciated. I know of guitartricks and truefire. I am just wary as I don‚Äôt want to sign up and just get taught scales and positions, I need help understanding, interpreting and actually using them.

I don't have any air conditioning, and I've been starting to get worried about my guitars, since I often pick them up in the afternoon to find them out of tune by a half step. The house doesn't just instantly heat up, which is good, but it hits its peak temperature around 1-2pm, and then starts to cool from there. If this is going to cause issues for my guitars, are there any tips on how to prevent it or minimize the effects?"
guitar,"I'm someone who's been playing for a few years on electric, and I feel diversifying my experience with something acoustic. I'm very comfortable with buying electric guitars since I know what kind of things to look for to determine if an instrument is good quality or if it will suit my tastes. That knowledge doesn't really translate to acoustic instruments though, so I'm finding myself a bit overwhelmed. If anyone can offer me some pointers on what options exist and what things to look for I would be very grateful. I'm looking for the most in depth information I can find on this subject. Thank you in advance"
guitar,"Hi. Iv'e been given this Shaftsbury (image on bbcode -  [https://ibb.co/HBwB8Rm](https://ibb.co/HBwB8Rm) ) which a mate had in her loft. Its from the early 70's I believe but is missing the biscuit bridge.

I've never owned a resonator before but am quite eager to get it back to it's glory but I'm not sure if a standard off the shelf biscuit would fit or indeed if I need to be looking for something else.

This is (I think) what I need [https://www.stewmac.com/parts-and-hardware/all-hardware-and-parts-by-instrument/resonator-guitar-parts/maple-biscuit-bridge/](https://www.stewmac.com/parts-and-hardware/all-hardware-and-parts-by-instrument/resonator-guitar-parts/maple-biscuit-bridge/)

I don't even know how it will sound as the entire cone may be gone on the inside and I'm no Luther so repairing it may be more cost than it's worth if that is the case as I have no idea of its value.. But one thing at once :)

I am in the UK so if anyone knows any supllier of the biscuits here then that also would be a great help.

Any guidance please would be appreciated."
guitar,"I think piano pedagogy deals with a lot of things which are overlooked in guitar world: the importance of fixed fingerings (""muscular memory""), how to develop and use our different types of memory to learn the instrument, how to create a practice schedule in the most effective way, the very ideia that ""you develop by sleeping"" (yep, this shocked me), and many other points. Where can I find something similar but for guitar? I'm not into classical guitar."

I‚Äôm a current pianist and composer, I‚Äôve been working for years in music and produce tracks, mix and master for clients, and more. I have a very good grasp on music theory, chord structure, harmony, etc. etc.

My question is, what is the roadmap for someone like myself on a guitar? I can name all the notes in any chord name you show me, but I cannot for my life tell you more than 5 chords on the guitar! 

I need help understanding how chords work on this thing. Should I be remembering shapes, or is it brute force by remembering the notes on the fretboard and creating on the spot? Are most shapes set in stone or are they movable? Any advice would be so greatly appreciated. I just need guidance on the path I should take to get where I‚Äôm trying to be.

My overall goal is to play more math rock / jazz guitar. Big lush extended chords, but I‚Äôd imagine I should learn to walk before I can run. 

P.S. how do you memorize chords? Do you write them in a book? Is there a big directory somewhere?"

guitar,"Hey everyone,

I recently had a water leak in my suite. A restoration company has come in and left a big industrial dehumidifier in my unit to dry out all the wet wood and the ceiling assembly. They asked me to keep it running 24hrs a day but I'm concerned about the impact this is might have on my 2 acoustic guitars. The dehumidifier is in the kitchen and the guitars are in the living room, however the dehumidifier is huge and obviously powerful and there is no door (just a hallway) separating the rooms. I've been told it might be here for a while.

I have two options:

1. Store them in their hard cases with humidifiers unless I am playing them. I would need to buy these, so if anyone has any recommendations it would be appreciated. I see a few different types/brands on Amazon.
2. Leave them at a friend's place and don't play guitar for the time being until we're done with the dehumidifier.

Wondering if anyone has any advice for my situation. Will the humidifiers in hard cases be sufficient to prevent the guitars from drying out? Or Is that too risky?

Any insights are appreciated

Thanks!"

guitar,"I don't know if this is a common thing, but say you have a small group of friends over for drinks and somebody asks you to play a song or something because they notice your guitar rig and are excited about it.

You do it, but people are talking over you, not listening, not paying attention. It feels pretty bad and then I just feel like I don't want to perform anymore and that it's not really worth my time. I lose all motivation to be doing it because it's just so awkward and unexciting.

Other times I don't even ever start playing because I'm not gonna stop everybody's conversation and announce ""Hello friends, I am going to play a song now, please shut up and listen because x number of people are requesting I do this and I'd like to.""

I don't think it's that I don't have any situation awareness or I'm popping out wonderwall to play during a crowded house party or anything. It's not a skill issue either, I'm pretty confident I don't sound like a dying elephant. I also feel like this isn't a one time thing, no matter what group of people/friends this outcome is very very common unless they're all also musicians.

Does anybody else have this issue? Is it just me? Is it just commonly understood that if you perform you should assume you are background music and most people won't truly be litsening and appreciating it? How should I mentally approach this type of situation? Should I just refuse to play anything if somebody asks and explain to them I don't want to have this outcome happen? Would love some perspectives.

And, as I'd like a 24.75"" scale length there is basically nothing at all with two of the items on my wish list.

What's holding back what seems like an obvious move for manufacturers - it's hard to believe with manufacturing processes now that it would be much extra work or cost to use steel (or Evo gold) for a lot of guitars.

Right now, I'll probably get my ES-339 re-fretted with stainless steel instead of buying something new and wait to see what appears on the market."
guitar,"I've been in the same band with te same drummer for 3 years, a guy I've known for 17 years now. At first things worked out great, it was fun and we made good songs, but since a year or so, he started to always question every guitar riff, I'm the guitarist and songwriter, and have no problem with working out my demo songs together with the band. But this drummer has developed the habit of constantly saying what I have to play, and how I have to play it, he calls this 'working' together.. Whatever song I make, he'll always try to change every riff, and with that changing and destroying the entire vibe of a song. It's as if he only wants his drum beats to sound like he thinks it's cool. Honestly I think he's become so self centered that he just wants to has his finger in every riff of the song to feel good about himself. I'm a highly sensitive person so the way I make my songs, the riffs in the song match together creating the vibe I feel at the moment, creating a cohesive song. His actions completely destroy the vibe of a song, resulting in what I call very superficial songs with no deep feeling in the song. This interference frustrates me to the point I don't even want to make songs for the band anymore, as it feels as if he just destroys the songs. The bass player is great, he's a good guy who comes prepared, knows the songs, creates and records inspirational bass riffs, but he also acknowledges how hard it's become to work with this drummer. Sadly we're in the market for a new singer, so it wouldn't be smart to just kick this drummer out, as I'd be left with only the bass player, which would make it even harder to find a new singer..

from  1:00 to 1:12 it Sounds like a normal (Overdriven?) Sound but from 1:12  to 1:20 the sound is more.. Specific towards a special range?

Can i get that sound with an Equalizer, a compressor, some other Pedal or was it made with Software?

I am quite a big noob when it comes to Pedals and i just started playing not to long ago.

I hope someone can help me out with this. I dont know what the term would be when searching for it D:"
guitar,Should I be posting my guitar riffs on my YouTube channel as shorts or as videos?
guitar,Im a beginner and this is the first solo I‚Äôm learning but I can‚Äôt get the tone right. I have a Boss GT-1 pedal and a Fender Frontman 10G amp. I‚Äôm currently using a premade set called octafuzz lead.
guitar,"I recently acquired my first guitar, the Solar A2.6, and I was eager to upgrade my tuning experience by ordering a set of locking tuners. However, to my disappointment, I discovered that the Gotoh SG381-07 MG-T Locking 6R B set I purchased did not fit my guitar as the posts were too short and did not protrude enough from the headstock. Despite the set including two tuners with slightly longer posts, they too were incompatible.

I am now on the lookout for alternative black locking tuners that would fit my guitar, ideally with a matte finish. Can you suggest any other options that would be suitable for me?"
guitar,"I already googled for the answer a bit but I guess it's a good idea to ask here.

So this week I got my first e guitar, the Sire Larry Carlton S3. I noticed a buzzing sound coming from some of the strings, no matter how well I play. Is there anything I can do about it? I heard adjusting the truss rod might help but before doing it I'd rather ask for possible causes since idk if it will actually fix the problem."

guitar," 

Hey everyone, I'm using an ibanez gio RG 170 dx and I wanted to learn the ""whammy bar flutter"" technique, where you hit the whammy bar fast with the bottom of your hand and it creates a sort of a ""fluttery"" sound (often used by a lot of prog metal/instrumental players ). The problem is, I couldn't do it on my guitar, and after some research, I learned that you have to have a ""Floating Bridge"" ,I'm not really sure but mine is not floating, it's stuck to the body.

I would love to get some info about floating bridges, what they are, how can I get one, and if there's another way I could perform the technique.  
Thanks!!"
guitar,"Hey, Basically the title. Not matter what I do all my tones are too muddy. Going for a good stoner rock tone that still lets me play out individual notes and let them be heard.
Any Helps appreciate!"
guitar,"Yesterday, I bought a Gibson ‚Äò64 SG with a Maestro bridge. After playing it last night I think the bridge isn‚Äôt for me. 

I only have a couple days to return/exchange so I need some help.

1- Do these things stay in tune? I don‚Äôt plan to use the bar much but I‚Äôd like the guitar to stay in tune without having to constantly adjust it. Without touching the bar, it was drifting in and out last night. I know I can lube the nut and do things to help but I don‚Äôt a battle I need to constantly fight. 
2- Anyone use this bridge for heavier music? I got the SG for Sabbath type stuff.

Should I exchange for a fixed bridge SG?"
guitar,"
Hi, I just finished cleaning the rust on my frets with music nomad suede cloth and the FRINE fret polish tube.

The cloth gets yellow and dirty after used. Should I clean it with water?

Or if I don‚Äôt wash it, can I still use this cloth to clean other parts of surfaces of my guitar?"
guitar,"I have been playing the guitar for a year now. I haven't taken any lessons yet, so I'm not really that good. I can play some solos though, and I will attempt to learn a new one. 

So, which one should I learn: Sweating bullets solo (Megadeth) or Seek and Destroy solo (Metallica)? 

I have attempted both, and they seem doable (so far....) But it will take a lot of practise. So What do you guys think? I'd also appreciate some tips!
Thanks in advance!"
guitar,"So I recently purchased an Ibanez grg121dx online.
What I noticed was that the action was really high while the strings were too ""flabby"" or ""lose"".

I usually play metal i.e alot of sweeping pick, fast shredding etc.

I was having trouble handling it, as the higher E string would wobble around alot.
I prefer to use downtunings, especially Drop C or Eflat standard. The strings provided were that of 10gauge


What would you suggest, I set the action to? Including the string tension for more fast playing without getting the strings dangling around?"
guitar,"I searched and found a lot of information where if you touch your string and it stops, that's normal.  But nothing about touching a metal part of the amp.  This is also something that just started happening today and is unbearably loud if I use distortion.   Getting some pops and crackling whe touching the strings at times too.

The amp is a solid state Fender Ultimate Chorus.  It sounded amazing until today.  

Any ideas out there?"
guitar," As title suggests, I have been pretty bored lately and find myself always finding something to do. What sucks is I know I have zero patience for something like learning to play an instrument, especially because I have ZERO musical background/knowledge (never played an instrument in my life).

It feels super intimidating learning chords and everything, so I've been hesitant to buy a guitar. I know, fingerstyle guitar is extremely difficult so I'm sure I'll have to learn the basics first.

I just want some advice, maybe anybody who was or am in the same situation as me. How was your experience learning guitar?"

guitar,"Looking for a nice guitar for metal. Ideally an HH set up with a larger scale. I‚Äôve been looking at the Fender Squier classic series guitars, but the one thing that‚Äôs turning me off is the amount of frets. There are 21 frets, and I know that some metal may go a bit higher than that. I also feel like by the time I need to go that high, I could get another guitar. So basically what I‚Äôm asking is, should I worry about the 21 frets now or later?"
guitar,"Just picked the guitar back up and learned TNT, I‚Äôm trying to find the next song I want to learn."
guitar,"I use an off brand les paul and I am in a band, I already have 1 pedal and its a boss ds-1 and im planning on buying more pedals like a wah pedal. Is it worth it to trade my marshall MG30 for a fender Princeton 112 plus? Since the fender has more wattage in comparison to my marshall but does the sound of it fit the les paul and is it a better pedal platform in comparison to the marshall?"
guitar,"
I need a secondary guitar for gigging to leave in open tunings. However, I don't want to leave it only in one tuning, but go between two. I'm guessing this should be a hardtail, but I've never loved the feel of telecasters. Any other recommendations for guitars that will handle tuning changes on the fly?"
guitar,"Is it one of those things that just need a label on the guitar but it‚Äôs not THAT dangerous? I‚Äôm a newbie, and couldn‚Äôt really find any answers online, I tried opening my guitar to fix my volume knob, and was hesitant because of the warning label, and the inside of the guitar had a weird smell, just want to make sure I‚Äôm not gonna attract cancer or anything, I got a ESP EC10."
guitar,"hey everyone! i‚Äôm into my third year of playing guitar and decided to get another guitar, i‚Äôve been playing on a les paul style guitar up until now so i have no idea about these bridges, tuning, restringing and just general maintenance. i‚Äôve heard they are really annoying and difficult but i was curious if there was anything i should know about the bridge as someone who has never played one? Thanks!"
guitar,"I have an Earthquaker Devices Hizumitas Fuzz Sustainer pedal with a volume\\level knob and when I turn it up, it doesn't get any louder. It did this before and then started working fine but now its doing it again. And of course its 2 weeks past the 1 year mark for any warranty. Do you think its just a case of it crapping out or something that can be fixed?"

guitar,I just bought this 2010 Made in Mexico Telecaster on Reverb and have really enjoyed it. Just a little cleaning up and it was all ready to go. I've only started learning to play but this is so much more comfortable than the hand-me-down Sears guitar my dad bought in the 70's
guitar,"Howdy all,

I recently started making my own cables and have run into a bit of an issue.

I am using 8mm Paracord in addition to medium MDPC-X to add some flair to my cables. This makes the cables quite thick. I have tried two 1/4"" connectors the Rean Neutrik NYS224G (gold tip) and the Neutrik NP2X-B.

Now with just the paracord I can fit the NYS224G over paracord just fine and with some finagling, I believe I could make the NP2X-B work as well. However, once I add the MDPC-X into the mix neither will really fit over the sleeving. I kinda get the NP2X-B to sorta almost get there, but I wouldn't call it ideal.

I could just put the connectors on as far as I can, but leave it in front of the sleeving and then just shrink tube over (I would be shrink tubing regardless), but I hate that I guess and would much rather at least have the connector sit over the sleeving properly.

Are there any connectors that would work? I'd prefer something like the NP2X-B as the strain relief design is leagues better than the NYS224G and I also prefer at least a gold tip for additional rust prevention, but at this point any product that could solve the need would do.

Some photos are in the link below to try and help visualize everything.

guitar,"I want a Les Paul style guitar. I already have a Mexi Strat, PRS CE-24, PRS SE-24, Ibanez Artcore AM-73 semi-hollow, Fernandes AGP Super Strat with Floyd Rose and a Sustainer pickup. 

I want something with fixed bridge and two humbuckers that plays nice, has comfortable, thin neck profile and doesn't weigh over 8.5 lb. 

I like the humbuckers to be clear and chimey as I typically don't play high gain tones, and if I do, I'll use the Fernandez guitar for it. 
I have the Eric Johnson DiMarzio humbuckers on my Ibanez Artcore and they are great, super clear and articulate. I want something along those lines on the Les Paul.

I considered the Sire L7, ESP LTD EC-401 (or used EC-1000), Epiphone Les Paul 1959 Standard, Eart EGLP 620. 

Which one is closest to my requirements? Something else I'm missing?"
guitar,"So I decided I wanted to learn Time of Your Life by Green Day and I knew the lyrics and have been practicing the finger picking since I got my guitar in 2019.

It did not sound good lol: https://imgur.com/a/tiM26fI  

But when does it ever sound good on the first try‚Ä¶ that wasn‚Äôt the first try.

So yeah. Maybe you can tell, when I focus on singing I mess up my fingers and vice versa. That‚Äôs a matter of training to multitask on that level‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the easy answer. Is there any advice/suggestions for exercises or anything that can help me multitask better?

guitar,"Kia ora all,

I‚Äôm curious if anyone can recommend any resources that look at electric guitar from a sound design, tonal perspective?

I‚Äôd love to flesh out my repertoire of classic &amp; experimental sounds: everything from spaghetti western twang to high gain noise rock.

I‚Äôm primarily a piano (and synth) player, but I‚Äôm an enormous fan of guitar sounds and have been increasingly exploring guitars as my main compositional tool. A big part of that exploration is tonal: using guitars as a way to build texture and ambience in addition to more traditional composition.

As a veteran synth player, I can usually reverse engineer a sound pretty quickly, but as a guitar noob I often hear sounds or tones I don‚Äôt have any idea how to recreate.

The synth world is overloaded with information about synth sound design, and I‚Äôd love to find similar resources for guitar!"
guitar,"
I have been tuning to Eb since the early 80s. When I had 1-2 guitars both were tuned to Eb. When I was in bands, we tuned to Eb.

Now, I have 12 guitars and about 1/2 are tuned to the beloved Eb and the rest E. I have some tuned to regular pitch mainly to play with my son, play along with backing tracks and on the rare occasion I go jam with people.

Do others that primarily tune to Eb have some guitars tuned to E? Thx!"
guitar,"So I was gifted a Nashville Guitar works Telecaster and immediately noticed a pretty loud buzz. Knocked out the bad cable theory, and found that my middle setting doesn't have this issue at all. Saw some old posts online talking about grounding but I'm just not sure if that is my problem. Anybody know what's causing this and how to fix it? Thanks!"
guitar,"Just some background, I started off playing mainly acoustic.  My brothers bought me a looper pedal in April and that led me down a path where I've been messing around with the electric and exploring different sounds through pedals and and amps.  

My question is what is drawing YOU to either playing acoustic or electric guitar? I feel like every day, I change my mind multiple times on which instrument I want to pick up.  

On the electric side, I'm an absolute John Mayer stan (playing the Silver Sky SE) but have been SO inspired every time I hear some sick Tom Misch lick and especially a girthy, fuzzy guitar part from Joey Landreth.  
On the flipside, I love how the acoustic is so self-sustaining when it comes to producing a beautiful sound.  And the fact that it forces you to play a little differently because of lack of distortion, less access to higher frets, etc.  

Please drop below what's been inspiring you lately; it's a great time to be a music listener with all the great stuff that's out there."
guitar,"Hey guys, been playing guitar off and on for a good 10 years now. I'd consider myself an intermediate player. I've played almost exclusively acoustic up to this point and I want to pick up an electric guitar and small amp. There's so much out there I'm not really sure where to start. I'm looking for a quality setup that will last. Budget could go up to 1k for the right setup. Just wanna hear what you like playing and why. Thanks to everyone that offers advice"

Since a while, I've been working on a new pedalboard setup. Among other pedals, I have a Biyang Tri Reverb RV-10 and a Proco Rat 2.

guitar,"I recently tried out a player plus Tele at a music shop and really loved it.

guitar,"Weird question, and feel weird for asking but I'm not sure if it's a complicated or obvious one. I don't know the answer tho.

guitar,"I bought a room humidifier for the room I keep my guitars in today. In previous winters, I have dealt with some guitar issues pertaining to lack of moisture. I do my best to control the temp in the house, I figure next step is to try to control the moisture. I read online that you should keep your guitars between 40 and 50 percent humidity. 

For those of you that use a humidifier, is this where you keep them? Also, are there any tips or suggestions relating to placement or humidifier usage that I should be aware of? I obviously didn‚Äôt put the humidifier right under them or where it would blow directly on them. I am also aware that over humidifying guitars can do just as much damage. 

Any tips or moisture percentage advice is welcomed."

i recently got an audio interface and headphones to start diving into the plugin world. After trying some plugins i was really satisfied with the sound and wanted to upgrade to speakers so i could just jam along in my room like i do in my solid state amp. I have a pair of Pioneer Dm 40 speakers that i use for my vinyl player so i bought the needed cables and tried out playing guitar with them but it sounds weird, bassy and boomy and without clarity.

Another big difference i noticed (and one of the most annoying ones) was the way the sound changes so much depending on my position, i can dial in somewhat of a decent tone trough the speakers but if i get up to play standing up the sound becomes completely muffled and loses all the high end clarity. I know that there's always difference depending on the position you're in but its drasticaly diferent in comparison to the solid state amp that i could basically turn him to any side of the room and could get up and sit down and the sound wouldn't lose clarity like this. The thing is, when i play music trough the speakers like vinyl or with the pc/phone this sound difference depending on the position is very slight, like with the solid state amp, so i ask if anyone has any insight that can help me."
guitar,"Carlos Santana is regarded as one of the elite electric guitarist of all time. Some even say the best. But he also leaves a mark as a bandleader. He can go from hard rock to jazz to fusion to world music, but he always goes back to that ‚ÄúSantana sound‚Äú. This of course includes his singing guitar playing, but also the delightful percussion that has helped to make Latin music popular in the late 20th century. So what is his legacy as a guitarist? What is his legacy as a band leader?"

I know most scale shapes and arpeggios, yet my solos sound very mediocre at best
I usually stick to playing notes within the scale and some arpeggios/power chords. Sometimes I go out of the scale for that ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù sound, but still, my solos sound like a bunch of safe notes with no direction whatsoever.


Is there any approach I need to take to become a better soloist? Should I just learn a bunch of licks and implement them into my playing? Or do I need to learn more theory? 
Any tips would be appreciated!"

guitar,"No matter how you play, a sentence to keep you going is you're still making a sound from an inanimate object.. And that's amazing on itself so keep going, your sound will be better with time

Practice with backing tracks and improvise, it will really help you get more skilled while having fun, especially if you're the type who gets bored easily when learning tabs or songs. You'll improve your ears, you'll want to make certain sounds so you will search how to do that, or you'll incorporate everything you see in your playing somehow, one way or another. Your playing should improve tremendously over time, and suddenly you will feel it. Practice with slow songs at first, it will help you pace. If you make a wrong note, try to do it right in the next verse, but just keep going. If you need to, stop and evaluate the next note by hearing, try so many different things and you'll find it. 

Close your eyes and just let the music flow outside you, don't pinpoint on every slip or every mistake. 

Eat before playing or energize somehow, because playing takes a lot of energy and while you're tired, you may not sound as good as you would like. You're using your mental and physical abilities with high to medium concentration, that uses up a lot of energy.

Try as much as you can to play in a place where you can avoid distractions when jamming, especially if there are people who constantly talk to you. Sometimes you lose focus and your left right brain gets outta whack by talking.. If you're a singer also, I salute you for being able to sing and play at the same time.

Widen your horizon of music you listen to, especially if you're into metal or rock (I mean it should apply to other genres, but that's what I listen to and play). Maybe your style is a slower one, maybe shredding isn't the best feature (practice it here and there though)

It can be really magnificent the amount of playing you can do with just a couple of notes and styling of playing (long notes, bending, sliding, etc). Remember you don't have to be fast to sweep people away with your playing. Sometimes a slow emotional song can go a long way.

Stay in scale boxes but then move out of them, and gradually play along the whole fretboard. That changes everything, but you gotta rent a box before moving out to a villa üòâ Play in the box, increase your speed, improve your accuracy, but here and there you can peek into other sides and grab a note from neighboring boxes. After sometime, you'll find the whole village helping you play. 

Incremental improvement will happen the more and more you play.. Just play üé∏ü§òüèª"

I don't know what do you call those, vintage style? Anyways, I was wondering how do you restring those properly. The last time I did it the regular way pushing the string through the middle and trying to wine it around, its pretty hard because the string would pop out of the top often, so there must be a better way to string these sorts of tuner.

guitar,"Hey everyone, I recently picked up guitar and I went with a Squier Stratocaster Bundle kit with the fender amp and cable, as I wanted to see if I‚Äôll like guitar and tbh so far I‚Äôve loved it and can‚Äôt stop playing, been doing like 2-4 hours a day. But I‚Äôm think I want to swap it out and get a better practice amp such as the Positive Grid Spark 40W amp and a better guitar such as one of those Jackson Dinky guitars along with a Ernie Ball cable(unless you recommend another cable?) I‚Äôve heard some good things about Jackson Dinky, just unsure which one to get exactly. 

I‚Äôm interested in learning to play Green Day, Three Days Grace, Avenged Sevenfold, etc. would you recommend either of those guitars over the other? 

Also, so far I‚Äôve been following Martymusic, Justinguitar and just recently discovered Synner for learning guitar. And I got a cable for rock smith as well to try to learn some stuff through there as well. Any other recommendations or do you think I have all my bases covered? 


Thanks!"
guitar,"is it worth it? i‚Äôm looking to add a telecaster to my collection and i‚Äôm wondering if the player series telecaster is worth it, or if i should keep saving and get into a higher optioned model tele. 

what are the pros and cons of the player series? does it still have that classic blues tone that comes from a tele? i wouldn‚Äôt be playing shows with it. just playing at home or with friends every once in a while.

guitar,"hey all, looking to pick up a telecaster. not looking to spend a fortune, although i would love to after looking at some different models. 

my question is, is the player series telecaster worth the $850 or should i keep saving for a higher optioned model. does it still have that bluesy tone that teles are known for, or did they skip right over that with the player series? 

i‚Äôm not going to be playing shows or anything, just noodling around and playing with friends. my current arsenal is a strat, an SG, a prs silver sky, and a prs custom 24. i‚Äôve always wanted a tele so figured this was a good place to start.

Love the way it looks, plays, and feels but there was some things I thought it'd have.

1. a glossy finish to the neck, its more of a matte finish (I should've checked the specs, still would have bought it)
2. A darker, more rich tone to the neck... which is what I'm most concerned about.

Here's the side by side. For context, it has a Satin Urethane finish [https://i.imgur.com/bvlZrDs.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bvlZrDs.jpg)

I was wondering what I should do?  Is there a method where I can achieve the glossy finish, darker tone, and preferably not have to sand it down? Let it age so it can darken because I heard that happens? Or should I just contact fender?"

guitar,"Hi fellow guitarists,

I am playing electric guitar for 16 years now, playing mostly hard rock &amp; metal (power metal) stuff. I had a band for 9 years and hardly left my style bracket. Now, I'd like to expand my range and not play only stuff that consists of power chords, single string shreds and palm muting. At best, I'd love to look into funk guitar or songs that employ clean-ish chords or melodic licks. 

And this is really hard to find, because whenever I search for some sample songs to play with these criteria, I mostly find classic rock or oldschool guitarists (Malmsteem, Van Halen etc.) and thats mostly it. As a child of the 90's, I have little interest in old records from the 70s or 80s (that always sound poorly imo) and would love to play more recent stuff, that still does not consist of mostly powerchords as it is in many pop songs.

Can anybody point me out to artists or bands that I could look into?"
guitar,"As I‚Äôm shopping for a new guitar, I‚Äôve noticed that most websites and buying guides start you out with a simple dichotomy: Do you want to play bluesy classic rock, or metal? Aka do you want single coils or humbuckers.  Obviously any type of music can be played on any type of guitar, and these guides are trying to narrow things down, but I was wondering if there are brands or guides that cater to other musical genres?  Most advice seems to be go with fender/gibson if you want to play boomer rock, get ibanez/Jackson/whatever if you want to play metal.  And even though those are way oversimplified, and those brands sell a wide variety of guitars, even on their websites they tend to show ‚Äúmetal guys‚Äù on any of their guitars with humbuckers and ‚Äúbluesy rock guys‚Äù on their single coils.  What are the guitars for the jam band folks?? Is there a brand for jazz guitarists that everyone gravitates to that isn‚Äôt normally discussed on these forums? Basically my question is, what are the brands/types of guitars that should be associated (even if only a stereotype) with other genres of music?"

Idea being, I could make good use of the DI and headphone out, and rent a speaker for whatever rehearsal or gig I play. I also want fx from pedals, not on the amp, so that's nice too. 

But these two combo amps seem like a much better value for a little bit more in terms of price (on sale anyways). Have you ever had a chance to play both? What are your opinions on them? 

The Fender is pricier normally, but I've heard really amazing things about Traynor so I wouldn't be surprised if build quality is comparable. I also wouldn't mind being able to plug a separate amp head into these combos, and I can't tell if that's possible or not.

I want to be able to substitute members if somebody is unavailable so I want to have some type of sheet music to distribute. My preference would be to just get some staff paper, write time signature, tempo, measures with chord symbols, and repeats where applicable to create some structure but not actually mark out notes or anything like that. Does that seem reasonable? Everybody I play with is competent musically, they're just not professionals. I think in most cases that would be enough information to keep everyone together.

guitar,"Maybe it‚Äôs because i have old strings, but if there is a way to fix it other than changing the strings plz tell me 
Here is a video demonstrating the problem

guitar,"There's an artist I listen to who only has the bridge pickup in his Les Paul copy, due to the constant beating up of the guitar it's unlikely to be the original one too. So maybe some of you who have some knowledge and experience with various LP bridge pickups could help. Though it might not be the exact one some pointing in the right direction would help.

I would describe the tone as quite sharp, but at the same time not thin by any means, quite warm, but gritty within itself with various nuances in the phasing of the strings.

LP bridge pickups and guitars I have tried in the past tend to have more definition on the separate strings when strumming, whereas this artist tends to have a more grouped together, warmer, forceful sound.

I really appreciate any thoughts, thank you!"
guitar,"I have a Rivera Rockcrusher from ages ago and use it as an attenuator, but it's not the recording version. Since it's not the recording version, does it have a loadbox and can it be used for silent (Or it least close to silent) recording purposes with an IR in my DAW, or would I still need a separate loadbox altogether to go direct out?"
guitar," Hi guys i found in market place this guitar, its a squier body with a neck of a japanese stratocaster... How can i realize if its a real fender neck or only a copy... Its worth to buy this guitar? [https://imgur.com/a/srq5Wlz](https://imgur.com/a/srq5Wlz) these are the photos, i Will ask for more..."
guitar,"Just curious, I know you guys secretly like the headstocks"
guitar,I bought toneforge menace and I've looked at several videos of how to get good tones with it but it still sounds weak and thin. Any tips?
guitar,"hey guys, what string gauge would yall recommend for C# standard tuning (C#, F#, B, E, G#, C#)? i‚Äôve been getting back into nu metal and this tuning was used a lot (wes borland, billy howerdel, etc etc). i use 10-46‚Äôs when im playing system of a down (drop C/C#) but i feel like these will be too floppy for anything lower. any suggestions on gauge or even brand? thanks!"
guitar,"i have an extremely limited budget as im a high schooler with a job paying barely over minimum wage. i found a great deal on the valveking at a local guitar center, but im a little worried about the overall quality. 

i mainly play rhythm metal guitar (my main influences are glenn tipton, james hetfield, dave mustaine and adrian smith) and i don't want a polished sound. is it going to be a good fit?"
guitar,"Due to certain reasons I cannot visit guitar shop physically. Can someone tell me about the touch and feel of the fretboard and also the difference in sound, obviously.

Maybe also tell difference between the both Crossroads and Blackbird model as aell. Which one to buy?"
guitar,"I am going to make a hole in the soundboard between the sound hole and the bridge to fit a p90 style pickup in a steel string acoustic guitar. I am afraid this may weaken the construction which is why I will fit the guitar with a floating bridge.

The current bridge is similar in design to a typical nylon string guitar bridge, and I mean to keep it so not to mess up the scale lenght. My question is: should I route the strings from the floating bridge through or over the holes of the current bridge?"
guitar,"I bought a used Epiphone Modern Figured Les Paul the other day and realized after I bought it that it has minor cracks in the fretboard. It goes from the 7th to the 18th fret. I played it for a bit in the store and somehow didn‚Äôt notice. I can return it in the next 40 or so days for full money back guarantee. This is my first electric guitar, so I could return it for something else. Love it to bits right now, but will the cracks affect it‚Äôs long term condition and sound? Do I return it and get something else, keep it, repair it? I don‚Äôt know. Please let me know what you think!"
guitar,"Budget is a little flexible.  But I currently have a bc rich warlock modded and its great for heavy thrashy stuff.  I want a nice guitar for my next and probably something that's a little more versatile for the other stuff I play.  More classic rock stuff like rush and lynyrd skynyrd.  Something that can kinda fill in most genres besides thrash metal/heavier metal stuff.  A couple I've looked into and researched are the Van nuys (tele shape) and then fender telecasters.  Not particularly just into the tele shape, just a coincidence.  I usually go for more flashy guitars, pointy, or atleast different."
guitar,"Like, I know it's lower tuning, so it's going to sound heavier. I get that 100%. Basically, my low end just seems to drown out my mid to high end. The guitar is a super-strat build with an unfinished (tung oiled and sealed) body and a charvel maple/maple neck, so I figured I'd get a more bright sound. Also, running a single dimarzio super distortion with 1 vol knob no capacitor. The output does seem a bit low, as I've read super distortion should be around 13 on a multimeter where I'm reading a little over 9. Any thoughts or prayers?"
guitar,"I've been having issues dealing with the weight of my strat lately. I have a really messed up back and it hurts to sit down while I play so I usually stand up, but that strat sure gets heavy after a while. I mainly play acoustic and don't have these issues with that. I have an old Peavy that was my first electric and it's super light, but only a single humbucker and I don't get anywhere close to the same sound as my strat. I had a Les Paul a couple years ago but traded that in bc it was also really heavy. I didn't think the strat was that heavy at first, but I think I was just really excited when I got it. Are there any multi-pickup guitars that are really light weight and affordable? Will any of them give me a similar sound to my HSS strat? Thanks in advance."
guitar,"I started playing guitar last week and since then have progressed much quicker than I thought I would. Now at I am wondering what daily practice routine should I take on and what a roadmap would look like for a fairly quick but effective learning progression. Any suggestions are appreciated!

-Thank you!"
guitar,"I recently bought my first Floyd rose guitar (Schecter c7 Silver mountain fr-s) and I can't lock in the whammy bar inside the bridge it fits in but it doesn't stay there and it always falls off
Help anyone?"
guitar,"Pretty much says it all in the title. I can't date it on the Harmony website because it's older than the models they currently have. To my knowledge, it's a copy of the Gibson hummingbird. Not so much interested in value as I am the age of it. A lot of stuff online says it's vintage from around '75. 

Curious if anyone here has any insight. Pm me for pics of her"
guitar,"Actual posts promoting discussion over topics that don't have objective answers are removed because ""you can just Google it"" despite the post explicitly saying googling it hasn't gotten me anywhere, but the same questions can be posted ad nauseum with the same, objective, easily searchable answer with no complaint."
guitar,"As per title, is the CV really worth the jump in price? I‚Äôm getting back into playing and just want something to learn on again. If all went well I‚Äôd imagine I‚Äôd upgrade in a few years time anyway, so I‚Äôm wondering is it worth spending the extra initially?"
guitar,"Hi everyone, im totally new to playing the guitar, and i recently purchased an epiphone les paul SL. I got it along with a micro mustang amp so i‚Äôd be able to play silently but in many different ways. However, when i plug the amp in and connect my headset, there is absolutely no silencing from the outside. Is this normal? I‚Äôm not really seeing the whole ‚Äúsilent play‚Äù thing haha."
guitar,"I've been playing guitar for over a decade, I know music theory at an intermediate level, and I feel like I'm actually pretty good player who knows their way around the instrument. Does anyone have any resources or help they can offer on actually turning my ideas into songs? I come up with riffs all the time, but I can never figure out how to actually fit them into the context of a full piece of music, and I don't want to write jumbled messes of unrelated riffs. Everywhere I've looked has only ever had quick lessons on what chords are and how to play the standard ""4 chord"" progression. That doesn't help me actually come up with a piece of music. Where can I look for help?"
guitar,"Hi everyone.
Im trying to figure out why my amp sounds so weird. Basically on clean channel the low e string sounds the same as on overdrive.

When plucking the open low e string quite forcefully i can hear some faint rattling buzzing in the area around fret 1/2.

When i do the same with amp, speaker makes this engrossing humming sound at the end of note ringing. I will leave link for audio in comment. First part is clean channel and then i switch to overdrive.

Could it be that this faint buzzing makes amp speaker humm and sound weirdly?"
guitar,"Basically, I've had this dream of being in a punk rock band ever since I was little. Loved bands like Bad Religion and was also big on the emo and hard-core scenes growing up. Learned guitar fairly well (still getting better) and can sing and do harsh vocals of basically any variety. The only issue is that I have no idea where to even fucking start finding members or begin writing music. If any of you are in bands, how did you meet your members? Is it possible for a shut in bedroom guitarist to learn this power?"
guitar,I just got a classic vibes 50s Stratocaster and it‚Äôs amazing in all other aspects except when I try and use the whammy bar it makes no effect on the sound. I tried searching up about it and contacting the provider for more info but neither have come up with anything. Is there something I‚Äôm missing?
guitar,"I was recently asked to play with a group on lead guitar. It didn't go well. Normally I'd give a group some time, so we can figure each other out, but I'm not sure I want to go back. 

They didn't have a setlist, and would just start playing songs that I'd have to try and follow along. I couldn't even look at their chords because the others would turn away from me and to each other. And whenever I'd do what I thought was a nice lead or solo, considering I had no idea what they were playing, there'd be silence or ""remember when Bob was here?"" type comments. The guy who invited me was enthusiastic, so I feel bad. I don't know if it was hazing or what, but I just don't think I want to put myself through that again.

I don't want to ghost, or just come up with excuses why I can't make it. Do I just say I don't think I'm a good fit? Do I provide feedback on how they reached to my presence? Ask for clarification?"
guitar,"Hi, I was looking for locking tuners for my guitar, a Jackson sdx mn, mainly because I need to change strings fast. 
Anyone got any recommendations? Budget is around 100$."
guitar,"So I'm curious about the title question. I play metal and use an Empress Heavy to play through my cab, and I love the tone. When I go to record, though, plugging into my interface instead of the amp makes the sound terrible. It's incredibly thick and unclear, I don't even know how to describe it. Just the worst sound quality you can imagine while still being audible. I use plugins to avoid this, so I'm not complaining necessarily, I'm more just curious about why it happens. I understand that playing through a speaker (via a cab) affects sound produced because of the nature of it, but is that the only cause? The change in sound is so huge I feel like there must be some technological factor. 

Bonus question: would a modeler like a Helix produce a tone that is consistent regardless of what it's plugged into (amp/cab vs. interface)?"
guitar,"I have a Yamaha Pacifica 012J that came with a trem system but it did not come with a tremelo bar, does anyone know what size the hole or the bar so I can get one asap"
guitar," I really need some help deciding on my new amp to use in gigs, church, and practice.  

The amps:

1. Fender Champion 100
2. Fender Champion 100xl
3. Fender Mustang GT200

My thoughts:

1. Champion 100: it's old, and reviews said that the tone gets muddied up when turning up on high gain, I like the looks of it sticking with the traditional fender amp style, 2x12
2. Champion 100XL: Better speakers from the champion 100, I like it's tone and versatility, this is the amp I'm looking to buy at the moment, 2x12
3. Mustang GT200: I like that the 2 speakers is running on 100w, I like it's versitility, not really sure about the tone.

Really torn between these 3 amps, but I can only get one."
guitar,Is PRS still a good choice in 2023 or any other newer ones are better than a prs?
guitar,"Maybe Jazz guitar sounds the same no matter what instrument you use?

guitar,"I want to send a set of strings to a friend, but I don't know anything about steel strings(I do classical).  The guitar is an Epiphone Dove Pro/VB.  He only plays now and then, but I'd like to give him strings that would help him enjoy it (the current set he has must be years old, and dull as mud) and maybe encourage him to play more.  I believe he plays soft rock, folk, and such.  Any suggestions?"
guitar,"So I've decided that I want my first guitar to be Pacifica 112J. Amp will most likely be Orange Crush 12 because it seems very future-proof and it has great reviews. I wouldn't play outside of my room.          

What I'm not sure about are the accessories. Stuff like which picks, which tuner (is it even necessary), spare strings (how long do they even hold up), cable (if the guitar doesn't come with one) etc. I know I also want a strap and wall hanger but I can figure those out myself. Bag is not needed.      
     
The place I would be buying this all from is Muziker (dot) com, so if anyone has the time to recommend me stuff specifically from that shop, it would be much appreciated. The budget for the accessories is up to 100$, though it would be nice if I could save as much money as possible."
guitar,"So I've played piano most of my life and am trying to delve into the realm of guitars. I've decided I want to buy a low to mid-budget electric guitar, but I'm still on the fence about which one. The ones I'm considering are on the one side the ibanez gio hss, or the squier affinity stratocaster. On the other side, I personally love the way a squier affinity telecaster looks, and a wise man in a guitar shop once said 'the look of the guitar is half the decision, cuz it hangs on your wall half the time' and it made me doubt even more, because another smart man in the shop advised me to buy a hss (gio) guitar as a beginner. Therefore I need ya'll's help. I'm mostly interested in indie(rock) (the backseat lovers etc.) and more technical stuff. I'm a complete beginner.

BTW my budget allows for me to pick one level in price above what I mentioned, so the vibe 5/6/70s series for Squier and a more pricey ibanez would be possible, but not preferable."
guitar,"I was in the studio with my band yesterday for a mixing session. We noticed our bassist made a mistake but we convinced him to keep it in.

Got me thinking, What bands/artists have made mistakes they've kept on the final record?

I remember hearing one about a guitar lick on Hotel California! Where Joe pulled his high E off the fretboard causing it to ring out that natural harmonic you hear.

Does anyone know of any more?"
guitar,"I have a Jackson JS32 Dinky Arch Top Satin Black (this guitar, to be exact [https://imgur.com/a/zx06AFF](https://imgur.com/a/zx06AFF)), and I'm trying to figure out if it has a finished fretboard/neck, just so I know if I should oil the fretboard and/or the back of the neck or not (I read online that unfinished necks should be oiled too in addition to the fretboard, to avoid issues with truss rod adjustment in the future)"

guitar,"I just got a classical guitar from a garage sale and it's been weeks since i started practiced it, but currently i am facing several problems.

1.How to know if my classical guitar action is too high and how to fix it?

I found it difficult to press down the strings and often tend to use full force to press them while half of the time the threads can't even make clear sounds.Since classicals don't have truss rods i can't even fix it.What should i do?

2. How to play barred chords?

ik it's a stupid question and i have full knowledge of performing it, but i have difficulty playing barred chords on classical guitars due to the width of the fretboard being much higher than your average acoustic. Is there a specific technique?

guitar,"Hi, I'm a lefty looking into getting into guitar and was curious about handedness. Since most guitarists are right hand dominant, do they find that they have a slight advantage toward learning intricate picking vs learning intricate fingerings on the fretboard? When thinking about which style feels more comfortable to me, air guitaring with either feels about the same. So I was thinking, even if they're both completely new skills, I might as well correspond my dominant hand to the aspect of playing guitar that gives people more trouble. If the difference is negligible I'll probably just get a right handed guitar and call it a day, but I would love to get some feedback from people who know the instrument, thanks!"
guitar,"Hi,

So, I seem to have a recurring issue where my guitar (a stratocaster, typical vintage style pickups that are all wired correctly and soundly) is making *so much noise* when I'm playing with my band with any significant distortion?

The setup is almost always the same: I run an overdrive pedal into a quilter guitar amp head that has gain set around 3-5 and I just the wattage (the quilter can run from 2-100W) for headroom. Running even just one distortion pedal with most of the settings (tone, volume, and drive all set \~75-80%) leads to this awful, constant harmonic kind of feedback that happens with my volume on the guitar turned all of the way up, even if I'm muting the strings with my hands.

I've noticed that this can mostly go away if I back off the tone or drive/volume on the pedal a bit, but that takes away from the sound I want. Or if I play with the volume down to 8 on my guitar, it also can mostly go away, but again, not ideal. This is the second pedal to do this to me, so I don't think it's the pedal either. It also happens on a different guitar that I have that has a Dimarzio Chopper T in the bridge, so it seems to be something with how I'm running my set up rather than the guitars themselves? Or is it just the nature of playing in really tight spaces really loudly? Or is this just how distortion works at high volumes...?

I have a few guesses but would love to hear any ideas on what is going wrong and how i can fix it. It tends to be worse when we're rehearsing in a small room where I have loud amps (guitar, bass) facing my guitar if that could be an issue? Or should I be running my amp differently? I'm not sure.

An example of the sound is in this clip for reference: [https://soundcloud.com/ypal/screech-issues?ref=clipboard&amp;p=i&amp;c=1&amp;si=708558FD4FEA4C16B83DF91003C87F4B&amp;utm\_source=clipboard&amp;utm\_medium=text&amp;utm\_campaign=social\_sharing](https://soundcloud.com/ypal/screech-issues?ref=clipboard&amp;p=i&amp;c=1&amp;si=708558FD4FEA4C16B83DF91003C87F4B&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing)

guitar,"Hey there! I got an electric guitar from a thrift store a few months ago and decided to fix it up. I cleaned it, put new strings on, and rewired the electronics based on some diagrams I found. It has a single humbucker, a volume knob, and a tone knob. I can get a signal out of it but it is much weaker than my other guitar at the same settings. I have experimented with the wiring and got everything in the absolute best shape I could. The signal will run through pedals without triggering effects at all and I am very confused. The guitar seems pretty cheap so the electronics might just be bad or faulty.

Please help me."
guitar,"For some context I decided to become a multi-instrumentalist some years ago and bass was the first instrument I picked up to learn by myself. And finally after studying bass for 2 years straight I felt like it was time to move on and learn a new instrument so I bought myself a guitar. But there's a problem: ""The bass player mindset"".

I mean, I know some scales and chord shapes on guitar, I know how a guitar is supposed to work on a song, but whenever I'm playing it sounds like I'm just playing bass on guitar, hitting mostly the root notes, adding some fifths/thirds and playing some scales here and there. In short, I'm having trouble to sound like a guitarist playing guitar and I end up sounding like a bass player playing guitar instead.

So, for you guys who were in the same boat once, I got a few questions: 

* How did you get rid of the ""bass player mindset""? 
* What exercises helped you to improve?
* How difficult was the transition from bass to guitar?"

Nobody is testing the bridge pickup and how it sounds when playing heavy stuff or heavier tunings. Does anyone own this guitar and do you have some demo recordings that are of this nature? I can't play this guitar because this guitar can't be bought in my country. I went through 60 videos and  every one of them is the same."

guitar,"For some context I decided to become a multi-instrumentalist some years ago and bass was the first instrument I picked up to learn by myself. And finally after studying bass for 2 years straight I felt like it was time to move on and learn a new instrument so I bought myself a guitar. But there's a problem: The ""bass player mindset"".

I mean, I know some scales and chord shapes on guitar, I know how a guitar is supposed to work on a song, but whenever I'm playing it sounds like I'm just playing bass on guitar, hitting mostly the root notes, adding some fifths/thirds and playing some scales here and there. In short, I'm having trouble to sound like a guitarist playing guitar and I end up sounding like a bass player playing guitar instead.

So, for you guys who were in the same boat once, I got a few questions: 

* How did you get rid of the ""bass player mindset""? 
* What exercises helped you to improve?
* How difficult was the transition from bass to guitar?"

Right is my dominant arm. Write, throw, what you can can think off. Right handed.

Now i play left handed guitar because of a bad injury. Ny journey started 3 years ago, but my left hand(picking hand) doesnt cooperate at all. It really stresses me out. After 3 years practising i can't pick fast. My wrist is locked. If i pick with my dominant right hand, the movements are so tight and fast, even without ever practise at all.

It feels like there is no improvent at all.. also i have untameable tension in me rear shoulder(pickinghand) which is there from the start. Doesn't matter if is sit or stand. After 10 min or playing it starts.

I'm at a point to just give up. My music genre is hard rock/metal and i dont think i will be ever able to play it.

The amp can get loud enough but due to the lack of increase in the level knob, the tone doesn't sound full ( I should probably also add that i can't get the level knob to go above the 25% mark without it getting terrifyingly loud).

3. I have never played electric guitar before and have only played flatpicking on an f-hole acoustic guitar, which looks like this: [https://imgur.com/a/zvWwFaK](https://imgur.com/a/zvWwFaK). Since I do not own an electric, my only practice option is the one kept in the common music room of the hostel.
4. We have our semester break coming up very soon (mid-Feb to mid-March) , and I will be leaving for home. (Note: staying back is absolutely NOT an option) Since I do not own an electric, I will be only able to practise on the f-hole.
5. My goal now will be mainly to increase speed and accuracy. 
6. I tried jamming on the electric and had some difficulty playing it because:

* I have the habit of grounding my pinky on the scratch-guard on my guitar, which was very difficult to do on the electric. How do I change to playing with my right hand floating in a month?
* I have a problem with my pick holding; apparently it is detrimental to quick picking. I do it the 'incorrect' way in the image: [https://imgur.com/a/9pxQ5jM](https://imgur.com/a/9pxQ5jM). How do I change this in, again, a month?"

Hi, 

I've been playing electric guitar since the summer of 2022. I always liked this solo a lot, played by Tim Renwick on Al Stewart's song Life In Dark Water. I tried to learn it a while ago and gave up. The other day I tried again after becoming a lot more confident in my playing and it wasn't the same level of difficulty anymore. I tried to play it as well as I could and it's been quite a challenge to learn it since I had to figure some parts out by myself. 

Some parts are not that close to the original and but I am quite happy with this! I hope you enjoy it.

The video was recorded after I recorded the playing. There's no way for me to change effects while playing so I prefer to do that. Therefore some of the finger movement is not 100% accurate, since I tend to improvise while I play. Sorry about that."
guitar,"After not playing guitar for many years, I've realized that my amp doesn't work anymore. Instead of buying a new amp, I was considering using an audio interface with VST plugins for distortion and effects.

* If I connect it via USB to the PC, will I be able to listen the guitar via my PC speakers/headphones?
* Is it viable to play through the PC in real time without too much latency? I don't want the interface as a means to record myself, but to play in real time. Is it a good idea?

Bought myself an Omen Extreme 6 the other day and it's a beauty. I am trying to do some playing via my Scarlett 2i2 and I am getting a substantial amount of buzz from my bottom E and now and then my A. 

There are two distinct sounds. 

1.) A more pronounced annoying buzz. This one comes through the scarlet. It usually is most pronounced when playing E, A and D on one fret. Very raspy and annoying. Occurs towards the top of the guitar (where the action is) I'd say fret 1 through 6 is the worst of it but 3 and 5 ARE HORRID (Bad day for a tool fan hehe)

2.) When playing the bottom E a low hum like buzz can be faintly heard. It's a tad hard to make out but it's present. again, a low hum almost but still a buzz I think.

guitar,"I just got my first guitar, it's a yamaha pacifica 112 j. Everything looked fine when I unboxed it until I tried to connect it to the amp to find that it didn't make any sound. I tried the method where you kind of poke the end of the cable to see if it's working. It worked fine and made noise but when i plugged it into the guitar and strummed it there was no sound. So both the amp and cable are working just fine I'm assuming, the problem is the guitar I think? Can I please get some help?"

guitar,"Hello everyone.
Recently i bought my first electric guitar (Yamaha Pacifica 112j) and a small amp - Blackstar fly 3.
Since i dont have much knowledge about this vast guitar world I wanted to know if there is something wrong with my rig
Whenever i pluck the low e string with amp being on the clean channel it sounds very distorted. Actually the clean and overdrive channel sound exactly the same on low e to my untrained ear. What's weird is the last 3 strings thinner strings on clean channel sound relatively clean without that crazy humming and distortion.

I have a link for audio that i recorded from my phone. I can dm it to you, since you can't post links here. The first one is clean and then i change the channel to distortion.

Any help would be greatly appreciated"

guitar," Hi Guys,

I have just picked up the electric guitar after 20 years of not playing it :) Currently, I am living in an apartment so my old 50W tube lamp is not ideal for practice.

I was thinking something small like Yamaha THR10II should be nice.

I actually intend to play mostly through headphones but at the same time, I think it would be nice to have an amp to play with others even if that would be occasional.

Do you have any recommendations I should try? I play heavy metal like DIO, Iron Maiden, etc."
guitar,"Let me be clear with my question so it doesn't get deleted by the moderators. I am a paraplegic guitar player. I would love some suggestions for controlling effects without using feet, and with my hands mostly on the guitar. This precludes using pedals. I have an interface which allows me to use digital effects on my computer or phone, but again these require either a pedal to switch live, or the press of a button or key, something that is hard to do whilst playing guitar. Most of the products references in previous posts similar to this have been discontinued (Livid Guitar Wing for instance), so I'm interested in the current state of the art here. Thanks in advance!"

I'm in the market for my 1st good quality high gain amp head/cab for playing heavy music.

I always thought that that channel was the same as having basically ""1 more pedal."" 
You might use that channel but it's just one flavor of distortion. You might get tired of it, it might not have enough distortion etc.

Why don't amp makers just make an amazing clean channel so people can plug whatever distortion they want. (does having to channels cut the wattage of the amp in 2?)

Is there some ability that amp distortion has over pedals?"

Last week I found this little guy for 200‚Ç¨ and I bought it immediately no questions asked! It's an Epiphone SG Prophecy Custom with EMGs 81/85. I think it's about 10 years old, the seller didn't know the exact date either. 

The reason for the low price is that the neck has been broken and repaired with what seems to me a goob job. I have a deal with the seller that i can try it some days before pulling the trigger.

I wasn't planning on buying a guitar with active pickups because I'm not THAT into metal anymore but to be honest it's a beast and it plays smoothly and aggressively. 

It's a bit quirky, unusual and i think the tribal inlays are hilarious. Being dirt cheap is a nice plus too.

I'm actually liking it more than I would have thought. Very nice guitar, I think I'm keeping it to play some thrash metal when i feel like to!"

guitar,"Hi,  
I'm really keen for some advice because I've gotten myself thoroughly confused. I've recently gotten back into playing electric guitar and realised I can and should buy a new one. What I think I want is a used American Stratocaster, but I am not sure whether I am just hung up on the brand name. I'm also confused about whether a nicely set-up new non-American strat might be just as good.  
I've been trying out every guitar I can and these are my experiences (all played with no amp so I'm just judging pretty much by feel. I don't use an amp when I'm playing at home):  
My own 20 year old Fernandez Jazzmaster (Japanese I think) - holding up pretty well and I like the wide feel but it is getting noticeably decrepit now. Really feeling justified in a new purchase.  
PRS Standard (Indonesian) - surprisingly nice, felt pretty good. A noticeable step up from my Fernandez, but still felt somewhat budget.  
New Player Strat in store #1 (Mexican) - Not great. The neck felt dry and the frets harsh. Arguably worse than my Fernandez at home.  
New Player Strat in store #2 (Mexican) - unplayable? There was a noticeable buzz/dead spot around the 7th fret on the A string. Really confused about how bad this was.  
New Performer Strat in store (American) - beautiful. At this point in my research I was convinced the manufacture origin was a scam and I was all set to buy a Mexican strat, but this felt so nice after the Mexican Strats it changed my perspective all over again. It felt kind of perfect.  
New Guild Streamliner Jnr (unsure of origin) - shockingly great. This just sounded and felt really nice.  
New Gretch Streamliner - very nice, but weirdly felt not quite as comfortable as the Jnr.  
G&amp;L Strat, ""set up by a guy who knows what he's doing"" (unsure of origin) - really great. Possibly up there with the American strat. This felt like it was very much doing the job.  
New cheap Yamaha - not great.  
It's actually hard to get an idea of the exact price of a new American Strat where I live (Sydney Australia) and I'm not sure whether a used guitar is a good idea for me, as I don't really know what to look for. But they seem overpriced, and a used American Strat is generally only a few hundred more than a New Mexican one - at least on gumtree/Facebook marketplace. But maybe that's a stupid place to shop for a guitar, for reasons I'm unaware of...?  
I'm also wondering about the results of getting a guitar ""set up""... I don't really know what this means, and I've read/been told that a shitty sounding Mexican strat can be set up to play just as well as an American one. But the difference was so ridiculously extreme when I tested them in the shops that I find this hard to believe.  
I really don't know where to focus my obsessive attention while I'm saving up for it over the next few months... should I get a used American Fender strat, a nicely set up Mexican one, or a used / new G&amp;L?"
guitar,"I always these:1, focus on the pick hand rather than the fret hand. To play the wrong note is just a mistake,  but to play without rhythm is unforgivable.
 2: triangular picks, it doesn't matter how you pick them up, easy to hold, and you get 3 x the pick"
guitar,My school had this guitar in one of it's practice rooms ever since I've been there and I finally decided to take it home and show it some love by cleaning and fixing the electronics and whatnot. It's a hofner black solid body electric guitar. No other markings other than the brand on the headstock. I looked all over the internet trying to figure out what this thing is and I can't find it. It's a ghost fret with a bat symbol on the 12th fret and it's a double cut away with two humbuckers and a Les Paul style volume/ tone area.

I am a guitarist with 12 years of experience in eletric guitar, I have a few classic guitars but nothing to fancy. Now I am determinated to invest in a guitar for fingerstyle.

I know tsome brands that are really good like Taylor, Martin, Takamine and recently I discovery Baton Rouge and Enya.

I want a good guitar for recording and live performing altough my budget is not very high(1000 euros) and I don¬¥t have the possiblity to try the guitar before buy so I am here looking for opinions about fine guitar models that you guys would possible know that fine the purpose.

guitar,"The live version of the Crossroads song from Cream sounds like Clapton has his Gibson guitar with the volume rolled back slightly. 

Given that PA systems weren't as good as they were in the late 1960's, im guessing Clapton played through a cranked Plexi, which would have a lot of edge and aggressiveness.

The actual tone, including the rhythm and lead part, sounds more mellow in the top end that came from rolling back the volume knob from a cranked distorted plexi, rather than a lower output amp with the volume full on."

I currently have a Boss Katana 100w head that I use almost exclusively through headphones, but after playing a few tube amps I'm really sold on them. I'm thinking of getting a second-hand Mesa Mark V:25 head on reverb and coupling that with a Mesa 1x10 open-back cab (although open to alternatives at the same budget) and putting a Two Notes Captor attenuator between the head and cab to reduce the sound so it's at reasonable levels.

This has deterred me from pulling the trigger on a steel-string acoustic so I wanted to ask if this fear was unfounded?

So i‚Äôve been looking into using my amp head with my audio interface, but have
minimal knowledge on what i would need to do/buy to do so. So, my line will evidently go like this: guitar &gt; amp head &gt; (something here) &gt; audio interface &gt; pc &gt; miced speaker cab emulator &gt; output (speakers/headphones). The head i currently have is a mess single recto, so it has a paired 4 ohm output and a single 8ohm output. I know I need something along the lines of a dummy load? Something that can take the impedance of the head and turn the signal into a normal line signal, if that even makes sense. 

Let me know if you have any advice/experience doing similar."

He doesn't know how to play guitar, so I asked him to alternate picking as fast as the could, teaching him how to hold the pick, trying to show as little as possible the pick, and anchoring on the bridge, telling him to found his comfortable position.

It surprised me that with no practice, he was able to trem pick above at least 160bpm with his non-dominant hand and like 170bpm with is dominant hand.

My dominant hand struggles to keep 150bpm. My non-dominant hand can do the same in some strings (maybe because I am a lefty who practiced as right-handed) but much slower in others. My therapist told me that people with OCD (my case) are generally slower with fine motor skills, mentioning an experiment which I don't have any source now (sorry). I found that pretty curious.

So, what was your baseline trem picking speed if you know it?"

All of these are in regular rotation for various applications. 

* The SZ520 (Quilt-top burst) is the first guitar I ever bought brand new. It's one of my favorite players.

* The IC300 (Black with big weiner-shaped horn) was purchased before I knew how to drive and required an eight-mile walk to procure.

* The dark blue strat took me several years to acquire - I loved Mystic Blue metallic when it came out, but couldn't justify buying a new strat at the time. They were really hard to find in that color on the used market, so I finally pounced a couple of years ago when I found one.

* The white Squier is my project guitar. It's wired HSH with a coil tap. It's one of my best players, and really versatile. It took a while to reassemble, because I left the pickguard in the sun to get the aged look. I also scuffed it down to a matte white finish, because I thought it looked cool that way.

guitar,"Hi

I am in dire need of a new guitar amp. I currently use an Fender 85 (Red Knob) and there is just no life to it - flat, no dynamics, no soul. I recently tried both Roland JC, and AC10 in a store and loved both, but have some concerns with both. I will list my concerns below but if you could list any possible amps to consider that lie in the middle of both that would be great. 

Vox AC10
- I am a bedroom player but I like lots of headroom, the vox just got loud and gain-y too fast, which worries me with my very hot Humbucker and loud distortion pedals.

Roland JC-40
-Sounded amazing clean. Though I didn‚Äôt get a chance to use any pedals with it. This is a concern as I do not want it to sound as lifeless as my current amp does with my pedalboard, I want it to feel dynamic and rich when I hit a pedal, and dynamic and sparkly when clean. 

As you can see I am picky. And to make it worse I am specifically looking for a combo. But I do not care if it is Tube or SS. Last thing, I used to have a Vox AC15C1X (with celestion blues), and I sold it soon after as I had to crank it so loud to get a decent tone (but I maybe willing to try again). 

Any help would be appreciated, 

Thanks!"

It's been a long time coming but I'm so happy with where I am and what I got. It feels like I'm reunited with an old, warm, cozy friend. It will be the first of many but for now, I'm content. 

The ESP EC1000 feels wonderful, all I have done is lower the action a bit. I will be putting some thicker gauge strings on it as I like to play in drop C. It's such a solid feeling guitar though. Just good for everything. I wish they would have had a model with the Fishman Fluence pickups but I am very acquainted with EMG's and there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. 

The Boss Katana is definitely new to me but is such a cool amp! I'm picking up a cord to connect it to my computer so I can really have some fun. Honestly though, right out of the box it sounds really great! No shortage of volume either. I was pretty apprehensive to start over with guitar. It feels like I am trying to build a relationship with someone that I betrayed. But I'm going to put in the work again and start from square one."

guitar,"Hey friends. I recently picked up a beautiful late 70s Encore hollowbody guitar. I'm mostly a keyboardist but I couldn't resist when I saw it for sale in my town. It obviously hadn't been played for a while but tuned up fine so for the price (cheap) I took the risk. I got it home, gave it a clean up and this is when I noticed the glaring issue - the first 4-5 frets on each string produce the same note (I believe a tone above the open string) and on the high E the fifth, sixth and seventh fret all produce the same note again. Once past that the frets all seem to produce the correct pitch.

I don‚Äôt play guitar for a while since I finish high school.

In the nexts days I want buy a few guitars to start to play again. 

My first plan was buy fender telecaster and Stratocaster but is not available.

I‚Äôm living in a country who doesn‚Äôt have many resellers I found two store who sell Fender and Gibson/Epiphone also I don‚Äôt have much time to look around or travel to buy guitars and most of the store keep a lower units of guitars because is hard to sell due the high price. 

The store who sell Fender has more Squier and Affinity they don‚Äôt have Mexican or American version which is very difficult to find them in the store they sell it very quickly. 

I‚Äôm not at US which has a huge variety and different brands of guitar and I don‚Äôt expect to travel in the nexts weeks or months.

Is not an option to imports guitars and even Amazon doesn‚Äôt have much choice. 

 At moment I have only available to buy guitars from Gibson (SG, LP, Limited/Custom) &amp; Epiphone (SG, LP, Archtop and custom/Vintage/limited).

E.g some model they have at store mostly following the collections above.

I have an around 15 year-old electric I inherited from my brother, been learning on it for a bit.

I saw on the internet that this is a problem with acoustics, but I am unsure if it is a problem on electrics, or if it is supposed to be like that? That screw on the second picture also seems to be tilted, but there is a cut out for it as well, so again not sure if it is meant to be like that. 

Just to note, it was like this before I re stringed as well. Guitar was unused for a solid 10-12 years.

guitar,"Hoping someone out there can help me ID this pickup. I‚Äôve included pictures of the pickup, pots, cap, and knobs.

https://imgur.io/a/OqKz3y9

Backstory: Bought the guitar for chump change at a local thrift shop about 20 years ago. I remember the neck was warped and the action was terrible, which made it near unplayable. Being young, dumb, and in a high school jam band, we played it for one backyard show and then destroyed it in the name of rock n roll. 

Fortunately, I had the forethought to salvage the components. 
Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt remember what the guitar was, and so I have little frame of reference for ID‚Äôing these parts that have been sitting in my gear bin forever. 

At some point I‚Äôll use the components in a project guitar. If the pickup is anything worthwhile, maybe I‚Äôll even build or piece together the guitar around the components.

Here‚Äôs what I do know/recall about it: 
- it was an archtop 
- wood bridge
- single pickup
- pickup was made/stamped in 1958 (you can refer to the picture for reference - the stamp is off-center, but it looks like it reads ‚ÄúDec 2 1958‚Äù)
- and for a bonus wildcard‚Ä¶ I remember with 100% certainty that the headstock said ‚ÄúRoy.‚Äù What I don‚Äôt remember is whether the ‚ÄúRoy‚Äù was an original decal, or painted on by the previous owner. I vaguely recall the guitar having some subtle embellishments painted on the body, and I‚Äôm not aware of a ‚ÄúRoy‚Äù brand, so perhaps that‚Äôs all it is. 

Thanks."

So l've recently been getting into modding but l'm not sure if there's a specific type of humbucker I should put on a superstrat, it has a stand-alone switch for my neck and middle single pickups and a two-way switch for my bridge humbucker. So what kinda pick up should I go for?"
guitar," I'm  building a guitar and I really love the sound of jazzmasters (and  jaguars. idk what the difference between the two is tonally, really  lol). I'm thinking i want a sound sort of similar to that because all my  guitars are humbuckers. (One has a p90 in the neck but that's about  it.) I don't want to do jazzmaster pickups though because a) i plan on  buying a jazzmaster at some point so i dont need to cover that base and  2) i dont think the look of jazzmaster pickups will work for the body  i'm doing (it's sort of a modern tele style). whats an alternative to a  jazzmaster style pickup that maybe looks closer to a humbucker or  something like that?

For a sound reference, I really love these guys' guitar sound: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMLjl\_TXg-U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMLjl_TXg-U)

I‚Äôve checked the tremolo from the inside and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be hitting the body. I also checked that the sound is not coming from the nut but the tremolo itself.

I‚Äôm really trying to get an understanding of chords and chord theory.

I thought it would be helpful if I just took a step back and start by just memorizing a ton of chords, the most used ones. That‚Äôs where everyone started after all.

guitar,"I have a zoom g1x four pedal and Hughes and Kettner BK100 bass amp. I tried searching up for patches on youtube, and different styles, but whatever patch I used it sounded completely different than it should. I figured out that the problem is that I use a simulated amp and a real one at the same time, but since I don't have an audio interface I don't have any other options. How should I set up my amp to not differ the sound of the simulated one? I tried removing the simulated amp from the chain and setting up the real with the same setting but no luck. Any other suggestions?"
guitar,"I've been playing since '13 after falling in love with punk. 

I don't feel as passionate about music as I did back then. I don't want to play blues, or jazz, or metal, hard rock, etc. I've learned a few songs within those genres, but (I'm just going to say it) I honestly don't give a f anymore. 

Thinking of selling my Gibson but keeping my 1st ever electric. I'll stick it inside the storage room or smth. Maybe the passion will come back some day.

guitar,"Hey all,

Just picked up a used Cort EVL K4 (2006) yesterday, but the trem is looking pretty sad and missing the arm. This is a bit of a project guitar (I had an EVL Z4 through high school that I loved and regrettably let go of), so I'd like to upgrade it with a Gotoh GE1996T (33mm block I can get locally).

I've measured the existing brass block (looks to be 34mm) and had a rough check of the other dimensions, and in all measurements the Gotoh looks to come slightly under size if not the same.

I'm fairly confident this model should be a good drop in substitute, but before I fork out AU$300 for it, for any of you who've performed a similar upgrade:

* What are the implications of going with a slightly smaller brass block? Existing one is already on the smaller end from what I can tell, and I understand bigger may not necessarily fit.
* Anything else in particular I should be checking before buying? Tension screws look to be pretty well spot on with spacing. Having already dismantled the existing bridge I couldn't spot anything else that needs to line up like these do.

Thanks!"

guitar,"So. I had finally come to the conclusion that my old acoustic is a haggard beast, and it‚Äôs time for a new one. Lately, I‚Äôve been transitioning to playing a lot more fingerpicked jazz and classical over my regular thrash and blues rock routine. Rather than going for a new steel string Ive been thinking about keeping my old acoustic (with some work to get it playing flat) and buying a new side-rig to do more of the soft, warm, melodic playing that I‚Äôve been enjoying lately. That said, I still spend a lot of playing time between 12 and 19, and would still like a rig with a pickup so I can use it to play reggae and other stuff in gigs.

I‚Äôve been eying up the Yamaha NTX and the Godin Arena series, but I know there are a few others on the market. 

I‚Äôd love to know your opinion; I‚Äôm lost and can‚Äôt make a decision. Do you play either of these guitars? Different, similar guitars? Any recommendations?

When I first got into it I thought I could maybe play for 2, maybe 3 hrs a day and hone my skills, but ever since I got it I frequently find myself playing until I feel the need take a break, and then realizing it's 2am when I stop. 

I've missed class twice which isn't great at all but I figure it's better I put a stop to this sooner than later. At the same time, I def don't want to stop playing guitar altogether, especially since I've just started. I just had no clue how addictive this could be.

guitar,"So, if you have seen my post history, you know that I just got a tone king gremlin as my first entry into the tube amp world. It‚Äôs really great and would be perfect for me if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that my house has a fair amount of EMI interference that I can‚Äôt do anything about. I‚Äôve tried the amp at different locations and it works perfect, so my house just is an unlucky spot in the city. 

It‚Äôs looking like because of this I will have to return it and choose a different route. I‚Äôm just not quite satisfied with my boss katana as while I feel the cleans are actually rather solid, the higher gain stuff sounds very artificial to me. Also, the katana doesn‚Äôt respond very much to picking dynamics at all and is rather plain.

I‚Äôve had my eyes on a few different modeling setups - I already have an audio interface so using something like Neural DSP would be an option. But I‚Äôve already experimented with the Imperial Mark 2 and although it sounded decent, I found it to be pretty uninspiring and the entire process was fairly complicated with gain staging and starting up my computer, hoping for a more streamlined (physical perhaps) solution. 

Would something like Kemper or helix work well for me? I‚Äôm mostly a home player, and just want solid tones and something that has a tube amp feel. Budget is mostly not a concern so I‚Äôm open to suggestions.

The other idea is that I don‚Äôt return my current amp and just wait till I move out of my current house as it is a rental, but that could be anywhere from 1 to several years."
guitar,"I am new to guitar and even when I plug my new Harley Benton DC custom into my amp, I ALWAYS get this buzzing on the first fret, with buzzing on the 2nd to 4th frets sometimes.

guitar,"Does anyone have any setup ideas for musical theater?I'm not sure if I should go the pedalboard route or get a digital setup(which would probably be easier) and I'd like to get ideas from people who have done this before. For context I've just started taking guitar seriously this year because we needed a guitar player for our jazz band. I know nothing about effects/pedalboards and always play clean since jazz band doesn't really call for anything. I'm playing guitar 2 for our Mean Girls musical in March and my Band director is hiring a professional for guitar 1 that I'm gonna try and see if I can get in contact with to see what they're doing for their setup but that won't be for another week or two and I wanna get a general idea. I need something where I can switch between acoustic and electric easily and also tons of effects. Some of the effects are basic like distortion, tremolo, or delay but there's a lot of rather obscure tone descriptions which is making me shy away from a pedalboard and instead using something digital simply bc it's take a lot of experimentation to find the right sound and I don't wanna buy the wrong pedal especially cause I'm a teenager and tight on money. Some of the more obscure descriptions are things like ""ethereal airy fx"" or ""large body jazz tone""

I know about effects and what they do I just have never used anything before and my knowledge on how things work exactly is very limited.

I'm also unsure of what guitar(s) I should use for what. I have an LTD EC-50 that my uncle gave me that I use for jazz and I have thicker strings on there. My friend has a Squier Strat with thinner strings more for rock cause that's what she mostly plays. I'm not sure if I should switch between those two guitars(mine for jazz/slower songs and the strat everything else) or just stick with one for everything and only switch between the acoustic and electric. I might just be overcomplicating things idk. Any help or advice would be appreciated

I'd also have to have something that would hook up to a normal guitar amp cause I'd be using the schools amp. That one doesn't have any effects or anything just has adjustable volume and bass/treble."

Background: I've been playing for a number of years now, usually by myself, occasionally with friends. Until recently I lived alone, but about a year ago I moved in with my partner. It's great- except she gets massively bad headaches that get worse with loud noises. 

Here's my quandary: my amp is a slightly older Marshall DSL40c, the one without a headphone jack. I love the sound of my amp, but I can barely use it at home now. So, here's my options:

1) get an attenuator with a headphone out (recommendations would be awesome, something under $500usd)

2) get a smaller solid state amp with direct out, headphone out, and cab emulation (been looking at the Quilter Superblock UK or Hughes &amp; Kettner Ampman Classic)

The second option is nice as I wouldn't have drag around my Marshall for jamming with friends, but then I lose the the tubes. Any ideas, thoughts, or recommendations? Which would you do? 

TLDR- want to play quietly so as to not annoy partner and give headaches. Get new amp or get attenuator with headphone out?"

guitar,"Hi All,

This is W, creator and founder, of the Learn Guitar Exercises App. I wanted to inform everybody that my mobile app has just gone live on iOS and Android. I‚Äôve had some great feedback and responses from the community so far on their experience with the app, and wanted to put the word out.

The app will take you from the basics of fundamentals to the more advanced concepts in guitar playing. For instance, we have the following categories; Rhythm, Shred, Chords, Techniques and Scales. In each of these categories I start at the most basic and easy concepts and develop on them throughout the difficulties. For example, during the beginner chord lessons you will work on open chord changes at a reasonable tempo and by the advanced chord lessons you will be completing advanced chord changes involving variations at a quicker tempo. In between you will be exposed to everything you need to be a great player. And this goes for every category. 

My belief is that we all have different musical tastes, but fundamentally almost every genre utilizes the same techniques and drilling those through exercises is the best way to be a great musician and guitarist. It‚Äôs also a huge benefit to take a step away from practicing songs and riffs from songs, and work with unique lessons that will inspire your creativity and playing.

Did I mention that all the first 5 lessons in each beginner category are free, and the first three lessons in the intermediate and advanced categories are free as well? You have nothing to lose, as we do not ask for a credit card to be on file to use the app as a free practice resource unlike some other apps out there. We have over 500 lessons, so you‚Äôll have an exposure to numerous concepts and be able to tackle any song you‚Äôd want in the future with the skills you‚Äôll build.

So if this sounds good to you, visit https://LearnGuitarExercises.com to download the app on your device. You can also visit our TikTok to see some examples of the lessons we have. https://www.tiktok.com/@learnguitarexerciseapp. Please feel free to message me about comments or questions. I am constantly working on improving the experience, and my team (my wife and I) are excited to hear back from you all."

i am asking for help if anyone knows what might be the cause of this i have loosened and tightened screws and can provide video proof if anyone is willing to try and determine the cause.

this is my first post on here and while i am not a newbie to guitar i am not a genius so it could very well be something reslly simple. my discord is browne.sauce#8205"
guitar,"I really need some help deciding on my new amp to use in gigs, church, and practice. A store here recently have opened a summer promo and I have some amps on my price range that I am looking at. This is going to be my first amp from a Mooer GE150. I have looked at reviews all over the internet and just wanting to know your guys opinion and thoughts on these amps.

I am an Intermediate player, gigging, practicing, jamming, with my band, and a guitar player on our church.

The amps: 

1. Fender Champion 100
2. Fender Champion 100xl
3. Fender Mustang GT200
4. Fender Mustang GTX100

I will be building a pedalboard on the champions and will be using the built in effects and the footswitch on the mustangs, but like the convenience of the mustangs

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts:

1. Champion 100: it's old, and reviews said that the tone gets muddied up when turning up on high gain, I like the looks of it sticking with the traditional fender amp style, 2x12

2. Champion 100XL: Better speakers from the champion 100, I like it's tone and versatility, this is the amp i'm looking to buy at the moment, 2x12

3. Mustang GT200: I like that the 2 speakers is running on 100w, reviews say that it's a good modeling amp, 2x12, maybe to future proof my guitar career having 200w, it's too big but i'm fine with it, only included with a 4 button footswitch. 

4. Mustang GTX100: better than the GT series, I like it's tones very much and the included 7 button footswitch, only 1x12 (concerned on not being loud enough in a gig situation)

I just want an amp to do it all and not to worry on it not keeping up in the future and also the better buy for my money. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you guys!"

Top left to bottom right:

* Yamaha BB734A - My only bass. Does everything well. Bought it because I'm a guitarist first and wanted a nice do-it-all that wouldn't make me think of upgrading.
* Rivolta Combinata XVII - This one I'm actually selling. I had an accident on my fretting hand a few years ago and it's not cooperating with this neck profile, causing cramps (it does *feel* very comfortable though)
* Hagstrom Super Swede - My first proper guitar. Had a couple of headstock breaks but my magic luthier made it play as good as always. Have it tuned to E flat and it's getting the Dimarzio 36th Anis currently on the Aria soon.
* Aria Pro II YS-400 - My dad's old guitar from his band years in the 80s. Never selling for obvious reasons. Smoothed out the neck varnish and put a hipshot bridge on it because the original one was shot. It's getting the TCI S pickups I just took from the PRS because the Dimarzios make it too shrill.
* PRS SE Custom 24-08 - My current main, just came back from having the P-Rails installed. 2 3-way toggles and 2 push-pulls give me all the possible combinations and most sound really interesting, good, and usable. Also sanded the back of the neck to a satin finish and put SE lockers on it.

I feel so lucky to be able to own all these :)"
guitar,"I'm getting back into the electric guitar again and want to learn some older Bullet For My Valentine songs (songs by Trivium and other similar bands also). I was wondering what it's called when you have to palm mute just one of the two strings you're playing alternately, like in these songs, or even when you play a single string but play muted and unmuted notes alternately. Is it best to down strum or alternate strum, or does it depend on the song? Is the technique to quickly take your palm off the string for the unmuted notes and then back on quickly for the muted ones and repeat? Thanks.

Hey! Thanks for opening this post if you have, I'll be blunt and quick, I own an ESP LTD Viper-10 and I've been having a very specific issue when it comes to standing up with the belt every time I try to play standing up. Basically the bridge part of the guitar always goes down, it seems pretty unbalanced and it is really really annoying. Any of you guys or girls know if this could be caused by the weight of the guitar? Or is it maybe the belt I am using ( a friend gave it to me, the quality is very good, thick and robust material).

Well thanks for reading and thanks a lot if you respond me. I hope you have as much fun playing guitar as I do."

guitar,"So I've set the guitar up with the truss rod and saddle height with the correct measurements but I'm really confused with what positions to have the saddles positioned to start with?

 I seem to be able to tune the guitar to correct tuning no matter where the saddles are, then I can make a small adjustment to get the harmonic right?

Or is there more to this? I could have the saddles staggered, or straight, or as far forward or back as I wanted? Does it work that way? It doesn't seem to make a difference where the saddles are as long as I tune the guitar..
Adjusting the saddles also alters the tuning so what is the best way to make this simple for me to understand...

backstory: i haven‚Äôt owned a guitar in over a year. i had sold my mexican strat prior to a major move with the intent of repurchasing, but.. life, and ironically work, kept me from doing so. it feels good to have a strat in my hands again, and this being my first american, it‚Äôs all surreal right now. sonic blue/maple fretboard/mint green PG has always been my dream spec; all i ever saw were rosewood necks on americans, or the venturas, or the custom shops‚Ä¶ but then i discovered this rare spec.

this is indeed sky blue, not sonic blue, though they are nearly one and the same. fender offered this rare color from 1999-2002, if my sources are correct. no two sky blues look the same; the clear coat yellows over the decades and the finish turns slightly minty green. in fact, this strat has changed tints before my very eyes, depending on the time of day/sunlight. it‚Äôs such a cool color!!"

I requested a return using pictures of the internals being fake and how the neck was clearly ripped off some other legit Tele, alongside what it should‚Äôve looked like if it were legit and other details that prove it‚Äôs fake, but eBay customer service refused to take it back because ‚Äúitem may no longer be in the condition I received it.‚Äù I haven‚Äôt touched the internals at all, all I did was take off the pickguard and the backplate; there was nothing I did that changes the guitar in any way if I were to just screw the parts back on.

[New Strat](https://i.imgur.com/RXMMLQy.jpg)

I picked up this guitar about 2 weeks ago.   Its a 2006 Select FSR American Mahogany Strat.  When I got it someone had swapped it out for a white pickguard so I swapped that back and then took it to a local tech for a good set up.  Everything is great on it except the volume pot is being a little wonky which might be my fault for not being gentle enough during the pickguard swap.  Ill get it back apart when the strings are a little worn down and fix that one way or the other. Other than that,  it plays like a dream.  The neck is ultra smooth with great fretwork and I am digging the Texas Special pickups.   The mahogany body gives it more sustain than any other guitar I have.  This might be my new #1!"

guitar,"so last month i bought my electric guitar and amp and for the past month i have been practicing daily for hours and to my ignorance i had thought that i had gotten the hook on learning a lot of my favorite songs. However today i took my first guitar lesson and my teacher pointed out that i had been holding my guitar upside down this whole time. I realize now that the way i was playing and learning chords i mimicked the same fingering seen on chord sheets without realizing that i was not playing the chords on the right strings. My question is how come the songs i was playing sounded right when they were wrong this whole time?For example i would play Em on the G and E string whoch sounded to me identifcal to the songs i played along to.I know now how to properly hold my guitar and will do so from now on, but i am curious if playing all the wrong chords but with the same chord progression hold as a valid rendition of the song"
guitar,"There are some things which would have made it so much easier and more fun for me, had I known these things when I started playing guitar. I'll got first with these three tips:

1. Lighter strings, for example 10-38 are SO much easier to play, and make plenty of sound. Hendrix played with those strings. So don't go for the thick 12-56 strings because you think it will give more sound.
1. Try open tunings and drop D tuning.
1. Get a capo, it's great fun and gives you so many extra options.

I jammed with another guitarist and a bassist recently. We all tuned using the same tuner, but for some reason sounded horrible together.

We sounded a lot better and more in tune when I increased the pitch of my tuning slightly, by maybe a few cents. I read a little sharp on the timer when I did this. The others tuned normally.

Why? My guitar is intonated and sounds great and in tune when I play alone, or when I played with only the bassist. Why was I flat when playing with the second guitar and bass? Does my guitar suck? Why would I be flat on each string when I used the same tuner? Am I just out of tune for some reason?

Puzzled because tuning by ear worked a lot better than tuning using the same tuner. They have nicer guitars than me and theirs is set up too..."

guitar,"I‚Äôm self-taught on the guitar (electric and acoustic) and have been playing for a couple of years. I‚Äôm very much into playing rock guitar and similarly related genres, and while I‚Äôm decent at playing them practically, I feel that my tone is a bit shit. The sound I‚Äôm going for is a sound that can work well for many ends of the rock/metal spectrum from AC/DC to metalcore (I understand that there vastly different tones in that spectrum but I‚Äôm just a beginner and want a sound that works with me for many songs), but no matter what I do, a heavy sound on my guitar always sounds buzzy and nowhere near as polished as I want (also I understand that many sounds with guitars are produced and not a natural guitar sound but I‚Äôve heard live recordings of guitars that sound completely fine with no production). I have tried many combinations to make my gain sound the way I want it, I‚Äôve tried changing the treble, bass and medium nobs in different combos but none sound good, and different combos of gain but lower end sounds like classic rock (not the sound I‚Äôm going for) and high gain sounds buzzy and too much like Jimi Hendrix, again not a sound I‚Äôm going for. I have a Squier Mustang as my guitar and a Yamaha GA15II amp, if that helps if it‚Äôs the combo of guitar and amp or just the ones individually that don‚Äôt lend themselves well to a heavier tone. 

Even tho I have been playing for years, I‚Äôm still relatively a beginner, I don‚Äôt have much knowledge on guitar tone and how to change it effectively. If I‚Äôm missing something obvious please let me know as I feel that my tone is holding my sound quality back."

...this weekend my wife told me over dinner, ""You haven't had a new guitar the whole time we've been together. Would a new guitar be a good Valentine's/anniversary gift? I wasn't really sure what to get you, but I know you've been struggling with your other guitar.""

I got a hell of a deal. Normally priced $499, I got it open box from Musician's Friend because it had a slight ding on the headstock. Price? $289! Fantastic deal! It's my first Floyd Rose, as well as my first 24 fret, so it's definitely an adjustment. It's also my heaviest guitar.

Anyway, just excited about having a new guitar for the first time and wanted to share."

I am not touching anything on the guitar. But it SOUNDS like the tone knob is being turned up and down while I‚Äôm playing.

- could this be a wiring issue? If so, I‚Äôll take it to GC guitar tech 

- is this possibly a DAW issue? I texted the guitar tech who installed it at a small shop a few years ago, sent him the clip, and he thinks it may have something to do with DAW input receiving but they have no familiarity with daws or amp sims

guitar,"Well, I done got myself in a pickle sort of.  Was enjoying immersing myself in acoustic and singing for the better part of two years with a lot of progress and enjoyment to the point that it became therapy.
Kept looking for bands, not sure I wanted one but feeling musically like it was important.  Found a casual situation for singer/lead and they took me on based on my videos.  Guys, I am totally in over my head.
I‚Äôve got about ten songs with lead intros and riffs I need to learn fluently before the warm months get fully rolling.  The band is super chill.  They say it‚Äôs just for fun.  But they were a gigging band, and I know they want to gig.  Maybe not major fancy gigs but they want to play out and they want me learning lead so essentially it‚Äôs the same as if I had a band that was more ambitious.  
Am I going to need to pay for lessons?  The lessons I‚Äôm finding on YouTube are pretty basic and I learned a lot on acoustic already.  Or is this just a matter of practice?
I am not immediately in love with electric and lead.  I‚Äôm not immediately in love with being in a band either.  What gets me to put in hours of focused time is the love.  I‚Äôm hoping it comes to me."

The guy selling it completely redid the whole guitar and he thinks it used to be a squire classic vibe. It's got new locking tuners, new paint and pickgaurd, new trem block, new pots, and new Seymour duncan '59 hss pickups. This will be my first nicer electric guitar. I've been playing for about 5 years on a crappy $200 electric guitar and I'm ready to upgrade. This seems like a killer deal but am I missing out on the SSS configuration? I haven't played either before so im not sure what I would like. For reference I play a lot of RHCP, SRV, and jimi hendrix."
guitar,"Hi guys,

I know this is a constantly re-ocurring topic but I did research first and nothing that I already found on the internet helped.

So when I connect cable to the amp, there's this buzzing that doesn't disappear when I'm connecting guitar on the other end. It increases when turning the volume up but it only takes like 10% volume for it to be really freaking loud and unbearable. It's not some background humming but something that makes it unplayable especially on the headphones.

Drive works only when I give it max gain - everything less than max just sounds acoustic. Is it normal?  Buzzing decreases when I reduce gain but then it doesn't sound electric. And it sounds shitty when gain is max - really distorted sound.

Basically each of the switches: gain, bass, middle, treble and volume increase humming.

Touching metal parts of the guitar and both jack reduces noise."

I might be buying a new acoustic soon that will replace my main one - Cort Earth 100, so I narrowed down to the guitars below, which are available online where I live. They are all roughly between $550 - $900, dreadnoughts, and have no electronics, which is how I prefer it to be. What I'm looking for is a general upgrade in sound and build quality. I would appreciate recommendations and sharing your experience with any of the models, because unfortunately I won't be able to try them out in person.

I‚Äôve been playing guitar 6 months now. I‚Äôve been getting an hour of practice a day for 3 months now. Past 3 months I‚Äôve been only playing my electric and have had no issues with thumb pain. Past 3 days I switched to my acoustic and I‚Äôm getting thumb pain (the muscle area used for barre chords) this happened in the past and that‚Äôs why I switched to only playing my electric but I‚Äôd much rather play my acoustic. So my question is this a normal thing that I might just have to push through? OR could it be that my acoustic‚Äôs neck is too thick for my hand? I know everyone‚Äôs hands are vastly different so maybe it‚Äôs just not the right guitar for me? 

I take lessons and it‚Äôs not a technique thing, my teacher says my technique is great. Also I have had the guitar set up so it‚Äôs not that either.

With this in mind, I would like to ask which guitar I should buy between the Fender Stratocaster and the Pacifica 611 (or any other guitars that yall would recommend).

By this I mean the same strings but a totally different experience between sets.

About 4 months ago I set my acoustic up with D‚ÄôAddaro 10s.

I thought humidity maybe‚Ä¶ I dealt with it for as long as I could then 2 weeks ago I said f@%k it an changed them out again. Same exact strings and have since not having any issues at all with tuning. Even jamming for an hour or two then the next day jamming for an hour or two before needing any tuning.

guitar,"Hi. Recently I've been playing more than usually, so like 2 hours a day. I play electric guitar, mostly metal stuff, lots of downpicking. Recently I noticed than nail of my index finger wears out pretty fast while picking, first I filed it a bit so it would look even, not in a triangle shape, next day I asked my gf if she has any transparent nail polish, but I'm not sure how long it would last.

My question is: is nail wear while picking normal and after some time my nails will get used to it and et harder or grow faster, should I get used to nail polish, or should I reconsider my picking technique, because nails shouldn't wear out that fast, like after two hours of playing?

I've seen Gary Holt's post on instagram once where he said his wife does his nails (like transparent acrylic) before any big tour, because otherwise he would have a problem, but I don't know if that's normal and I just didn't realize, or am I doing something wrong?"

guitar,"Hey guys, hope everyone is doing well.

Been working on this project for a couple of years now. Me and a few guitar buddies created an A.I program that turns your goals into a super detailed weekly practice routine replicating an experienced teacher on steroids.

Our routines tell you;

* what to practice/how to practice
* what to read,
* When to move on to the next exercise
* how long to practice
* Material &amp; videos

Each practice guide is fully tailored weekly to your goals as a guitarist/musician.

**HERES HOW IT WORKS**:

1. Each person answers a few questions telling us your skill level and your goals and how much time you have to practice.
2. We take a look at your assessment and build your first practice guide for free to see if you like it.
3. After 3 days we give you a call to see how your first couple days of practice were,
4. And finally based on your feedback, we build a learning model based on your feedback to optimize the next 96 weeks of your practice routine around hitting your specific short-term, and long-term goals.

It's a paid service, but the plan is to make it way cheaper than actual lessons. But all students get their first guides free, and can cancel anytime if they don't want to pay.

Let me know what you think"

He seemed surprised i was struggling and getting buzzing with such simple chords. Particularly when it came to the top of the neck where my fingers have to reach across a greater distance

Is it normal to struggle to fret power chords when you're first starting? Or are my hands just too small to play guitar? Everyone seems to refer to it as if it's the simplest thing ever, but my third finger really struggles to reach.

guitar,"I like to use Ultimate Guitar Pro to learn songs. I use Official tabs when it makes sense to.  But sometimes, a user-submitted Pro tab is more accurate than the Official tab.

I'm a classically-trained musician, so standard notation is second-nature.  But I get it---to someone learning it for the first time, rhythm notation is weird.  I've dabbled in composition and arrangement, and when I started, I also struggled with proper rhythm notation.  So it makes sense that not every guitarist knows this stuff---especially those who started out with only rhythm-free tabs and then thought, *Hey, I should learn standard notation*.

So, I thought I should share this handy guide:[https://blogs.iu.edu/jsomcomposition/music-notation-style-guide/](https://blogs.iu.edu/jsomcomposition/music-notation-style-guide/)

guitar,"Hi guys! I'm pretty new to guitar but I'm not new to music as a whole, being a pianist for almost 8 years now. And I have a question that has been obsessing me since I started reading and practicing tabs:

WHY DO SOME PEOPLE TAB AS IF THEY ONLY HAD 2 STRINGS ON THEIR GUITAR? 

For example, instead of just tabbing ""0"" on the D string, they tab ""5"" on the A string

That gets me confused every time I see it. Like, using the open D string is wayy easier and more comfortable than going up to the 5th fret on the A string!

And I'm not talking about complicated tabs or whatever, just a single note that instead of being played on an open string, is being fretted at the other side of the neck. Just, **why**?

&amp;#x200B;

NB: I mainly encountered this style of tabbing on the Internet, so it is probably related to people just not knowing how to tab. However, I still want to know why some guitarists would play like this (assuming the people who make the tabs also play them)."

I've got a couple of questions about the ME 80 that someone might be able to help me with. I'm building out what I need after a long break from guitar.

After doing a lot of reserach I'm pretty much set on the ME 80 \*if\* I can make the following scenarios work:

\- I need to output the ME 80 to headphones much of the time because of my kids. I also want to be able to stream Spotify / YouTube into them from my phone via bluetooth so I can play over the top. Is there a tried and tested go-to set of headphones that will do this for me? Budget-wise I'd say anything up to $250 is about right.

\- If I find the looper on the ME 80 a bit restrictive (38 seconds), is it possible to chain the output into something like a Boss RC-5 down the road, which then connects to my headphones? So, as I want to add a new layer I can pick my patch from the ME 80, that feeds through to the RC-5, and the final output goes to my headphones.

I'm sure these are very basic questions, so apologies if the answers should be obvious! I know that the connection from the headphones to the hardware will have to be wired, but they also need to be able to pick up bluetooth from the phone at the same time.

I used to love writing music on keyboard workstations when I was a younger man, but there's not the space / convenience to do this kind of thing now I'm a dad. Very excited to get back in the game with guitar.

guitar,"I‚Äôve done a bit of a net search and found a few, but not a whole lot of info. Has anyone had a custom build done in Australia.

Would love to hear your take/see what you had made, do they stack up, etc.

Having done it, would you recommend it or go with a big brand custom shop instead?

Thanks."
guitar,"I picked my fender bullet strat up after a long time and after a few days of playing, I was playing like I had been before. But because I left it untouched for so long, a lot of dirt, dust and grime started to build up, so I decided to clean it.

After starting to clean the front, I noticed the [back panel](https://imgur.com/a/XAAqNM5) had a lot of stuff inside it and was super dusty so I decided to take the screws off, clean it up, and put it back on. When I put the screws back, the top left one (top left in image) didn't get locked in, it would screw in, but I couldn't feel it stop turning when I applied force, it was spinning. So I decided to play the guitar to test out if I messed something up and all the strings except the high e sounded fine. 

[How it sounds](https://youtu.be/HqAZAgpuLdc)

It doesn't scale properly with the frets, with it being 1 fret low when I get to the 12th fret or so, and doesn't match the other strings. It sort of sounds like its getting caught on something

[The pickup](https://imgur.com/a/XAAqNM5) (second image) looks a bit weird but I think that is normal. However, I do notice that the strings (especially high e) are not centered on the pickup.

Is it just a restringing that is needed? Or did I mess something up when opening up the panel. I didn't really touch anything inside because I thought it might break but I might've messed something up inside. Do I take it to the shop and let them figure it out?"
guitar,Hey hey I am looking for some advice on setting up a better way to play along with backing tracks. Right now I just plug my phone into the aux port in my amp but the sound quality isn‚Äôt ideal. My laptop speakers are not great to play along with. What do you use to play along with backing tracks?

guitar,"It might be a dumb question but I wanted to know the name of this particular technique. Sometimes when a guitarist is about to do a solo or start a song, they will slide the low E string from high to low fret. What's this technique called? 

Also, how to do it? I can't seem to hit the right note (I don't know which fret to start the slide and to stop at which fret)

This technique is similar to pick scrape, but when I search up slides on the search engine, it's not what I want. Thanks for your help"

guitar,"Hi guys. I have been playing guitar on a daily basis for a few months now and I'm starting to develop some - beginner- skills. However, I'm still pretty new to guitar, so I'm not still able to just listen to a song and get the chords out of it.

My favorite artist from all time is Enrique Urquijo, a Spanish songwriter that passed away 23 years ago. He wrote his songs in Spanish; however, he also made some casual covers of his idols, such as Jackson Browne or Elvis Costello. Among them, there are a few beautiful pieces that I also love, his voice was truly special.

He performed ""Til I Gain Control Again"" from Rodney Crowell, and I fell in love with his version. It's not a version itself; he just grabbed his guitar and played it and one of his friends recorded it without his notice. Here it is: https://youtu.be/1dbrr94mXfw

So, do somebody knows the chords and arpeggios that he uses?

Thanks in advance!"

Tenderly is a popular song published in 1946 with music by Walter Gross that became a popular jazz standard.

guitar,"So I‚Äôve been playing guitar for around 4-5 years now, self taught. I‚Äôm pretty good, and I‚Äôve developed an ear thanks to listening to a ton of Grateful Dead and Phish jams. I know a lot of chords and I know the basic pattern for major scales. I play trumpet in school and I‚Äôm taking music theory this year. My issue is that I‚Äôve learned the patterns rather than the notes. When I improvise a solo, I know the basic pattern (most likely pentatonic) and then the rest is just confident guessing with mostly good results. But my soloing can get repetitive and sometimes lacks creativity. 
 
I‚Äôd like to learn notes on guitar as notes rather than the sound this or that fret makes. How do I learn scales on guitar beyond the patterns. If you ask me what notes are in a scale, I can tell you if you give me a second, but I can‚Äôt connect that with the frets on guitar. I really want to push into the next stratosphere with my playing, so any advice would be greatly appreciated."

guitar,"Hi all. I've been playing for nearly 15 years now and this problem has plagued me since the beginning. I sweat a lot in general, and anytime I play guitar my hands are sweating at least a little bit which isn't an issue (actually it allows the fingers to glide up and down the strings nicely). But if I'm really getting into a solo, my hands seemingly instantly turn into floating lakes and I can't bend a string for more than .25 seconds without the string slipping and losing the note. I also corrode and cover brand new strings in a layer of grime within a few hours.

I'm trying to nail this SRV solo right now, and I have zero trouble with it - it's a tough solo but it is well within my abilities. Until we get to the bend that lasts 2 beats. It always, always slips and I'm about to give up on it. I don't know what to do. Wiping off my hands only helps for 5 seconds before they're coated again.

Before I place my fingers on the strings I can do the motion without any issues, but as soon as I fret my fingers and try the exact same motion I notice that my fingers are moving as if my hand is made of rubber and I can't seem to lock them, and since the fingers are moving that automatically causes me to move my wrist to compensate.

If I'd come up to the conclusion that d standard is not my thing, may I just switch back to e standard? Or would I have to redo the setup?
I already used to mount 011 gauge strings before the tuning change, so the strings had not changed. The question is: do I need to adjust the truss rod and/or bridge saddles?

Thanks In advance üôè"
guitar,"Here‚Äôs a video of him playing it recently - the song was recorded like 40 years ago and this video shows him trying to learn it again. So there are mistakes, but I‚Äôd love to know what tuning he‚Äôs using so I can figure out how to play it myself. 

Also posting a link to the original. Thanks to anyone who has any insight!!

I have a guitar that is busted but has a 59 in the neck and a JB in the bridge.

I‚Äôm considering putting the JB in the bridge of either the strat or electromatic.

I‚Äôm also considering putting the 59 in the bridge pickup of either the strat or the gretsch.

Any thoughts, experiences would be very welcome and appreciated.

Thank you!!"

guitar,"I am a part of a college mechanical engineering senior design team that is looking to develop an automatic strumming/plucking device that would only require one hand to play the chords of a guitar.

We are still in the design phase of creating this product but to give some context we want to create something that will allow the user to control the guitar strumming/ plucking through an external controller such as a foot pedal, or also allow the user to preprogram strumming/plucking/fingerstyle patterns.

We mainly want to ask some questions to ensure that our product achieves in helping a user thus we would love input from both¬†guitarists with/without physical disabilities!

Some questions that we have are:

* What are your first impressions of our idea? What are things we should be careful of and things that are commonly overlooked for similar devices?
* What are some of the main functions that you would want in an assistive product?
* What are some assistive products that you use that are helpful and why?
* Where do you play your guitar/how often are you packing it up to travel to different locations?
* What are the most important aspects of fingerstyle playing that would be important to include in our product?

If people are interested in our project, we would love to do some check-ins with how our project is going and if possible, receive feedback on how we could better our design. Additionally, if there are people who would be willing to talk more about their experiences and what they are looking for in a product like this please DM me!"

Here is SRV with ""So Excited"" live at el mocambo. I'm having the toughest time figuring out how to full bend vibrato, especially in tempo, like he does here. Obviously it's ridiculous to compare myself to stevie ray vaughan but it's nice (and fun) to chase his technique regardless. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can vibrato just fine with index, middle, and ring finger, or all 3, both up and down, but when I try to vibrato with a bend like this it's hard!! It's like my fingers on the bend are at their maximum height so to speak and trying to wiggle my wrist like you're supposed to for vibrato, my fingers won't go any higher. Am I misunderstanding something? Is this an issue with finger strength? I am playing on 11 gauge strings

&amp;#x200B;

The vibrato here literally makes the chorus in my opinion. It's dry without it and doesn't sound nearly as good, and he does these full step vibratos in many of his songs. Can anyone break this down and help me with my technique?"
guitar,"Hello, I joined this reddit community to see if I could get some opinions on my next guitar.

I am a relatively new player but I have bought several guitars. I'm really starting to improve and enjoy playing and am looking to trade for / buy something new. So far I have a Schecter c-1 platinum that I love, and a PRS SE Custom that I like. I also have a Breedlove acoustic and one of the baby Martin acoustics, neither of which I really enjoy playing that much.

The PRS is arguably a better guitar than the Schecter (it cost twice as much) but I really seem to prefer the tone and playability of the Schecter. I also had a lesser model Schecter before the C-1 and I loved that one as well. I have a Fender Mustang amp with like 200 tones and patches that I like playing around with. I don't listen to a ton of metal music, but when I'm playing I seem to really prefer the overdrive effects and sound.

So I guess my questions are: what is it exactly about the Schecter that I like over the other, and what other guitars might I look at with this preference in mind? Would like to spend less than $1000, Perhaps a bit more depending on the trade-in value of my acoustics.

I have had it in my mind that I should probably get a strat or telecaster (just because) but now I'm starting to think it will probably just play more similar to the PRS.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Tl;dr- I have Schecter and a PRS electric guitars, and I big time prefer the Schecter, what should I get next?

THANKS!"

guitar,"A good friend of mine gave me an old neck and body he has laying around and I've managed to rebuild it using all original parts. Kramer sealed tuners, JB humbucker, CT pot, etc. The coolest thing is the Floyd Rose original I scored. I understand the ST100 came with a single locking system, with a locking nut only, but this one has been upgraded with locking saddles in the bridge.

The only issue is it uses the original screws instead of bushings, and the composite (plywood) body is sort of caving in a little.

Would it be worth it to drill out those screw holes on a drill press and hammer in some threaded bushings? That seems to be the modern solution, but I also don't want to screw up a cool vintage (!) Kramer, even if it's a ""budget"" model. It's basically a Baretta with a plywood body, but the neck is NICE."

Or do I just go ahead and buy a replacement pickup? Bonus question #1 - any advice on how to find out what type of pickup I need to get?

Also, the poles on both pickups are a bit rusty. Bonus question #2 - aesthetics aside, is this going to impact on the sound coming through the pickups? Am I better off replacing both pickups? (I'd like to keep costs down, but if replacements will make a big difference then it might be worth it)"

Hello everyone!

However, I just bought new guitars to dive head-first straight back into one of my favourite hobbies of younger years. I'm just finding it hard to stretch how I used to, and pretty stiff overall.

guitar,"\[QUESTION\] I was at a concert tonight standing in the first row. I was right in front of the lead guitarist of the opening band, and he swapped 3 guitars during their performance, yet the 1/4 jack on all of them was always empty, no cable, no wireless transmitter. Since the rest of the band was actually playing, and I could also match his fingers with the music, I doubt they were playing a recording, it seems it would be less effort to actually play rather than match it all with the recording especially since they were playing progressive metal. Also accusing someone of not actually performing is pretty serious.

So I wonder if there are any wireless systems that don't require a 1/4 jack or a transmitter box on the strap or so. Maybe something directly connected to the inside circuitry? 2 of the guitars were PRS and the 3rd was a ltd i think. I looked him up online, and with the same guitars he has a cable all of the time, but there is another [picture](https://live.staticflickr.com/7297/9565247675_59f0de08cb_b.jpg) in which his guitar is not plugged in.

This video takes these two popular and ""basic"" chords and moves them across the neck, showing how to accurately do it as well as spice them up by identifying the intervals and turning them into sus2 and sus4 chords. 

Quick note: I'm tuned down a half step in this video so when I say the chord is F or C, *technically* they're E and B, but this only matters if you're playing along with me and realise they sound different.

guitar,"I've already tried googling the issue but no results or videos tried to replicate exactly what I was having so I'll give it a go here:

I have a Presonus AudioBox iOne. I use STL Amphub as a amplifier simulator for my guitar and it can run as it's own program without a DAW. In Amphub, you can select which driver to use: Windows Audio, Windows Audio (Low Latency Mode), Windows Audio (Exclusive Mode), DirectSound, or ASIO. I would choose ASIO as that's the kind of driver my interface typically uses. It's not as noticeable on clean tones, but is still audible, but it's very noticeable on distortion/high gain tones. I'm getting a static/white noise type of issue that will occur every few seconds. The sound doesn't constantly play, it just randomly pops in and out every few seconds. I know it's my XLR mic or my guitar and its cable because I've actually unplugged both from the interface and turned down every single knob on the interface and I still get that noise. I've tried different USB ports and it still doesn't eliminate the issue. I've tried different headphones with the interface as well and that didn't solve the issue. I'm not sure if it's my computer itself causing the issues and I don't know how to check/verify that. I will note that whenever I switch to the driver type in STL Amphub to Windows Audio, set my headphones as the output and the interface as the input, there isn't any noise, but that cause latency which isn't very ideal. I've tried running the amplifier simulator through a DAW and that didn't fix the issue either.

I'm learning ""Two Princes"" solo by Spin Doctors. I have the solo down decently enough but I watched the actual guitarist play it and he wrapped the thumb the whole time.

I‚Äôm using a Kurt cobain modified Jaguar which I am aware is probably not suited best for most metal core, but it is a beautiful guitar, and I‚Äôve been trying out some of their riffs from the album, but they just aren‚Äôt sounding quite right (especially the muted sections on animals).

I got a fender mustang lt25 amp and now trying to choose between the ltd snakebyte and jackson slx dx soloist. 

My taste in music has me gravitating towards either ltd or jackson. Im a big metallica fan and do like the feel and sound of the snakebyte. I was surprised how light it was considering the size but also how fun it was to play on. However, im not sure it'll be the best to solo/improvise with, since thats something i would like to eventually learn. I could be wrong though. 

On the other hand, the jackson surprised me with how comfortable it felt. I never played on a strat style before but it felt great and sounded awesome. Neck played really smooth too. The only thing that worried me was the floyd rose, ive never used a whammy bar system before so there would be a learning period for its use, setup, restringing.

Please let me know what you guys think. Im no expert by any means so Im also open to other suggestions. Ill try to respond the best i can."

Recently, we had a rehearsal which included quite a bit of hard strumming. I noticed that I was hitting the nail of my index finger against the strings when strumming downwards.

I have an olp stingray that I've had years. When I first bought it I swapped the stock pickup to a SD SMB4 and ran it passive until recently. 

Routed the body for the battery, wired it all in, it sounds good, but there's a constant underlying buzz. It's not affected by touching the strings, bridge etc so i don't think it's an ground problem. 

I'm confused as to why I have the signal but also this buzz.
I'm thinking I've got a couple of wires backwards but would I have any signal at all?

First time fitting active electronics so I'm  new to them.

I have noticed that the buzz/a hum gets quite loud if I'm poking around wires and moving the preamp but no loss of signal like if it was a cold joint or similar. 

I messaged the seller I bought it from as it was prepared thinking it's definitely me, but he  told me to solder black, red and bare, to negative, and green and white to positive. 

The black on SD is hot and green is ground. 

Any ideas?

Finding good chord progressions is so hard and coming up with your own fingerpicking pattern is impossible. I am usually quite creative, I mean I like to paint &amp; sculpt. But for some reason there‚Äôs a blockage when it comes to playing music.

guitar,"So I‚Äôve been practicing the Bm chord for the last month or so. I actually found it quite easy to play, it was just transitioning between it open chords that took a lot of practice. It‚Äôs still not perfect, but I‚Äôm at the stage where I can pretty much integrate it into songs (although not as smoothly as open chords). I‚Äôve now moved onto the F chord but I saw that a lot of people learn that first. Is that because it‚Äôs intrinsically harder? I‚Äôve got the shape down as it‚Äôs pretty much the same as Bm but I find it quite a bit harder to play, which was surprising. It seems it takes a lot more to get the strings to ring out than Bm. Is this normal and something to practice? Or does it sound like I am Doing something wrong?"

guitar,"Alright, has anyone else ever tried out the M-Steel and been absolutely f*cking blown away by the massive tone depth and resonance? 

I‚Äôve been using D‚ÄôAddario NYXL 10-52 since I picked up guitar again mid last year. On a whim (and since my wallet allowed) I wanted to see what else was out there as far as strings. So, I just restrung my LTD EX with M-Steel 10-52s, got it tuned up, and noticed just how LOUD these were acoustically. I‚Äôve been playing long enough to know what an electric sounds like unplugged, but this was wildly different. 

So, I turned on the amp on the clean channel and hit a low E. The tone coming from the string and what came out of the amp, was immediately, almost hauntingly, reminiscent of the first note of Metallica‚Äôs ‚ÄúSanitarium‚Äù. 

Is there something magical about this maraging steel core with cobalt that makes these things the ultimate tone-wise? Have I been living under a rock during my hiatus from playing? Because wow. I don‚Äôt know if I will go back to NYXLs. I‚Äôm also trying Elixir Nanowebs (used these in High School), Rotosound Blues, and DR Veritas (also all 10-52) to see what I like best, but I‚Äôm almost considering sending them back and just getting more of these. 

Anyon else had this kind of experience?"
guitar,"I really like the tone and look of the Epiphone ES-335, Casino and Riviera but, am I shooting myself in the foot going with a semi-hollow for an electric?

guitar,"Hi folks,

I'm really struggling to decide whether is a better choice to buy a new small amp or to get one of those amp simulating fx processors.

Basically, my doubts are:
-Does a modeling amp sound better than an amp sim pedal?
-Does a bass amp take an amp sim well? Is it more neutral?

I have a fender blues junior at my parents' home but it's too powerful for home use.


Here's some pros and cons
(P.S. I have a very low budget right now.)

AMP (Fender Mustang LT25 or Marshall Code25)
Pros:
-better tone (?)
-on board fx
-usb port for recording
-good for rehearsal
-good for small gigs
-179‚Ç¨ for the Fender or 185‚Ç¨ for the Marshall and the job is done 
-no excessive tweaking

Cons:
-won't be able to use fx with another amp
-no line out
-not good for playing with a drummer 


Multi-effect Processor (Valeton GP-100 or NUX MG-400)

Pros:
-amp models
-lots of fx (including exp pedal)
-looper
-usb port for recording 
-line out
-no amp needed for live use (if there's a PA)
-fx can be used with another amp

Cons:
-maybe tone not as good as proper amp (?)
- Valeton comes at 150‚Ç¨ while the NUX costs 218‚Ç¨ AMP NOT INCLUDED, maybe my brother can borrow me a little bass amp for rehearsal but I mean... It's a BASS amp
-lots of tweaking
-more cables=annoying

guitar,"Newbie here exploring the music theory and learning to play guitar. I just learnt about major and minor scales and how there's a specific formula for major and minor scale starting from a specific note (called the root/key of the scale).

Is it true that majority of the songs out there are in just a single scale? If that's true, I find it super hard to believe since a scale is a sequence of specific notes starting from a root note. Since it's one specific sequence, only way for you to generate different songs in a single scale would be to change the interval between notes of this scale. Am I missing something here? I can't wrap my head around how we can have hundreds of thousands of songs in a single scale by just changing the rhythm."

I have an acoustic guitar that has some issues. Couple of years ago, I left the capo on the 3rd fret for a couple of weeks or months (can‚Äôt remember exactly how long). Ever since then, it makes buzzing noises in between the first to the third fret and open strings on the fifth and sixth string are especially buzzy and out of tune. The Bb on the 4th string plays the B instead as well. Now my question is, how can I fix this issue? Has the neck completely bent or the nut / bridge needs to be replaced? Photos needed to identify this problem? 

I really regret doing such thing to my guitar but I was a newbie guitar player at the time.

I noticed that in the neck pocket it looks like there is a slight gap, and the Am. Std. doesn't have that.

Here's an image of the HWY 1, and the same shot of the Am. Std to compare. Is this normal to have a little gap like that on the HWY 1, is that causing any sustain or other issues? Any ideas to fix if it is in fact an issue?

guitar," I'll try to make this brief. If you don't want my situational backstory, skip straight to my question. Thanks in advance for listening/ the insight.

I have a Squire Strat that I got free with a 150$ year subscription to Fender play on black Friday (the kit that comes with a free amp, stand, picks, tuner, bag, strap, etc). I am assuming it is a Bullet strat, and probably the cheapest one they make given the price? I can't quite find the specifics on it.

I decided to go with this because I wanted to prove my myself I would play prior to spending real money on a guitar.

I actually played guitar for a number of months about 10 years ago and had an Epiphone Les Paul studio. I liked it quite a lot then, but I do not remember it having the wonderful feel in hand that this bottom barrel strat had.

I didn't think I had retained that much, but progress has been really fun and really encouraging. I've played anywhere from 12-25 hrs/ week for two months and am now playing open chords, power chords, barre chords and some decent riffs with relative ease. As a result, I decided to reward myself with my first ""real"" guitar- a Fender Player Telecaster. It is currently getting set up by our local guitar shop, with the lead time on that about 3-4 weeks. They're swamped, but I want it done well. I keep plugging away on my free strat in the mean time. I also got a new Amp, Yamaha THR30II. Its awesome.

I am really getting into guitar and have really broken through the barrier where I stalled out 10 years ago, largely in thanks to the plethora of online and virtual resources available to learn and play ( I am using Yousician, Fender Play, and Justin Guitar in addition to youtube and tabs). Once I start to plateau, I am planning on starting up some lessons locally. I am also building friendships with other musicians in the area which has helped immensely as well.

Moving forward, I am hoping to make use of both my two guitars to continue learning. The Tele is going to be my main player, but I am hoping to use my second guitar to trial different string setups and as a backup when my main guitar is out of commission for work and ultimately use both to continue learning. The strings on this free Strat are pretty much garbage compared to the Tele (I didn't realize how garbage until I played the Tele), and I never actually got it set up. Once I get my Tele, it would definitely be time for an official setup for the Strat and new strings for it.

**My question is- would it make sense to continue putting money into this free Black Friday Strat at this point, or am I just better off in the long run getting a proper Fender Strat and having it setup nicely to learn different string setups, ect (plus having a backup seems nice with as much as I am playing)? I do not mind playing this Free Squire, it feels decent (obviously not near as nice as the Player Tele), but it seems reasonable, but I have only ever played the three guitars. I just want some opinions whether this free guitar is worth a setup and paying for strings every few months at this point or whether now would be the time to spring for something else before I go spend a bunch of money on a guitar I got for free.**

I'm fortunate enough that spending money for a new guitar is not at all a financial concern of mine, but if the Freebee Strat will do 95% of the job and is worth the money going into it, I'd probably just keep rolling with it. Curious to get some thoughts. I am sure this is very subjective, but that's why I figured I would ask.

Thanks!"
guitar,"I have a Yamaha thr10 and MacBook, preferably it‚Äôs inexpensive and good quality. Thanks"
guitar,"Title says it all. If I tune from standard to drop D and then back to standard a couple times a week do I need to worry about extra wear and tear on the guitar? Or the strings?

Long term should I just buy another guitar (twist my arm lol) to keep in an alternate tuning?"
guitar,"When I was young my family lost everything.  I always wanted to play guitar but my family never had enough to purchase even the most necessary items such as food and a roof over our heads. After spending many years in shelters. We got out of the mess and were able to afford an apartment. My dad surprised me with my first ever guitar. I cried so hard. It was a used squier strat and I loved it so much. I slept with the guitar. I learned my first riffs and showed my dad what I learned. I could not be more grateful. Till this day guitar is a huge part of my life. I'm older now my family and my beautiful wife always pushes me to be better. I recently lost my job and my guitar collection is now an Epiphone Les Paul and a Player strat but playing guitar helped me keep my sanity while job hunting.

guitar,"Any ideas on how to get a decent old school heavy metal/thrash metal rhythm tone on a Dr. Z wreck jr (master volume trainwreck)? I'm looking for something to tighten it up a bit, I don't really need much more distortion. I have a timmy pedal which works nice but I'm wondering if there is another pedal that would work better. The main issue I have is the amp gets quite fizzy at higher preamp volume levels (and I need to set it at that level for the amount of distortion I want - about 9-10 oclock on the amp's preamp volume). I understand in an ideal world pushing the power tubes is going to sound best, but I'm not sure I feel comfortable blasting my neighbors away with this loud as f\*\*\* amp. I contacted Dr. Z and he doesn't think an attenuator would help, which leads me to...

Maybe I should just get another amp? I absolutely love the trainwreck, and for metal solos I play it works 100% fine, it is just the metal rhythm &amp; high gain tone that is lacking. Does anybody have a recommendation for a tight heavy metal amp, that cleans up well with the *guitar's* volume knob? I like to play cleaner passages that slowly build up towards high gain (and vice versa). Think from 100% clean all the way to a thick wall of sound distortion tone. I don't need something *quite* as dynamic as a trainwreck, but that is definitely a needed feature. I don't think I would be satisfied by playing the clean -&gt; overdrive passage with the trainwreck, then switching to another amp for the high distortion - that sounds like exactly the abrupt change I *don't* want.

High gain tones I enjoy: Soldano SLO, Trainwreck (obv.), old school Marshalls, etc. I make do for high gain rhythm with stuff like the Peavey 6505 or JCM 800, but those are very lacking when it comes to dynamics. I don't need something quite as tight as these two amps (I'm not playing 300bpm thrash metal here), they are just an example. I do need something that has a somewhat tight tone for palm muting though, the SLO is borderline too mushy.

Looking for something with a master volume or attenuated, to at least get to a reasonable volume (I usually play 1/4- max of 1/2 on the MV on my trainwreck, which I believe is a **loud** 15 watts).

Price is no object up to \~$3k. Ideally I suppose an early Plexi would be perfect + an attenuator, but I've heard mixed results when attenuating these and from what I understand it would still be crazy loud. Another amp that nearly nails this sound would be something like a bassman but again, insanely loud."

guitar,"Life-long player here.  Playing has become a really critical part of my life recently for a variety of reasons.  Partly because of my increased playing time and partly because I'm already predisposed to arthritis, my fretting index finger began to feel arthritic.

Does anyone have any tips for making the switch.  I'm finding that my usual way of visualizing the fretboard in patterns doesn't translate.  So I can visualize the shapes and intervals between notes in the harmonic minor scale- but I'd have to really think to think about what notes I was playing.

guitar,"Hey guys, I could really do with a little helps on understand some differences between sharps and flats. I understand that a C# and Db, for example, is tonally the same thing when played. However, let's say we're talking about the chord now instead of the notes so C# major and Db major - what is the preferred one to use for guitarists? Is it contextual or? Let's say I was teaching someone guitar and explaining major keys with a chart, what scale would I give them to learn? Or when learning a song, what name should I use if that chord happened to appear in a song?"

guitar,"This is a slightly awkward post to write. I'll try to be succinct, but I doubt it will turn out that way.

**Learn Guitar, Take 1** = I'm 13, my dad restrings a generic acoustic guitar (it was small, only 14 frets or so, maybe for kids?). I start taking lessons and learning ""Shenandoah"" from Mel Bay's Guitar Method Grade 1. It doesn't work. I stop taking lessons. I give up on Mel Bay. I still piddle around with guitar. I take up skateboarding. I almost fail 8th grade.

**Learn Guitar, Take 2** = I'm 15 turning 16, sophomore in high school, smitten with hair metal shredders in spite or because of their undeniable skill and extremely questionable taste. My hero, Joe Satriani, a trustworthy character in a sea of misfits, is scheduled to appear on a new show, *MTV Unplugged*. I set the VCR to record so I can relive what will surely be his acoustic pyrotechnics. I'm upset that some hokey blues guitarist named ""Stevie Ray"" something is opening. SRV launches into ""Rude Mood,"" absolutely annihilating a Guild 12-string. My life changes. I still listen to the shredders but it's not the same. I don't have the words I need to talk about SRV's tone and touch and...whatever it was I felt. I borrow a knockoff Strat and plug it directly into my record player's 1/4"" mic jack. I ruin the speakers. I'm in denial. I try to play pentatonic scales as fast as I can. I avoid the hard parts of learning. I'm never any good.

**Learn Guitar, Take 3** = I'm a good student, but lazy. I graduate high school and don't want to do anything. I'm on the outs (again) with my dad, a two-tour Vietnam Veteran with a Purple Heart. He's mad because I quit my job as a busboy. My favorite band is Tesla, who sits at some intersection of articulate guitar chops and something more important, like that thing I felt when I discovered SRV. Is it truth? I don't know. Tesla releases an album of acoustic covers. They play their versions of songs my dad must've listened to. I hate my dad because I love him. I miss him because I hate him. I buy The Ultimate Rock Guitar Fake Book. I learn how embarrassingly easy is it to play CCR and it seems like I'm in on some secret of the universe. I enjoy strumming. I think ""Lodi"" would be a good name for a car. I try to figure out what to do with myself. I make it to college in a few years. I save up and buy a Robin Ranger. I sell it to a bartender I work with for pennies on the dollar because he plays music with his kid and he really loves it.

**Learn Guitar, Take 4** = I'm 25. My dad's been dead for two years. Somehow I've ended up in a graduate film program in Ohio. I'm surrounded by kids with money, or at the very least by kids without money worries. I roll with it. I bury myself in loans. I decide I'll save the world with documentary videos. My mentor and advisor is a minor celebrity in the local music scene. He helped found Appalshop. He opened for Bobby Blue Bland and Dolly Parton in the 70s. He interviewed Doc Boggs and became friends with him. I haunt the local music store. There's not an Ibanez or Jackson in sight. I fall in love with Townes van Zandt and John Prine. I sign up for a lesson but there's too much going on with school, with my girlfriend, with the ghost of my dad. I  sell my guitar and buy a second mountain bike.

**Learn Guitar, Take 5** = I'm here on Reddit, a full 23 years later. I own a nice American HSS Strat and a cool Made in Japan Aero Telecaster with P90s. Despite a few affairs with Rocksmith on PS4 and some internet videos, I don't play them. They are, after all, *objets d'art* more than instruments to me. I've had my fill of film and video thanks to a couple of decades in marketing. I'm not complaining. I've made a good living. But I want to make something. I want a little sound studio here in my second house, with my second wife, for this second half of my life. I want to record an audiobook with my actor friends. I want to record my shitty guitar playing. I want another guitar for some goddamn reason. I wonder if I could actually learn music.

‚Äî

I guess I don't have a simple question for anyone here. It's a rainy Sunday and I needed to cast something into the digital realm. I can sift through Reddit to find out the best amp modeler, what's to love and hate about Strandberg guitars, how to make a podcast in GarageBand.

guitar,"So I have some money put aside for a new guitar (max. 3000‚Ç¨) and I'm exploring my options at the moment.

I've been heading towards a Maybach Lester but recently I've been yearning for a more modern heavy guitar with maybe a FR again and also a Lester would be just another traditional Gibson design next to my Firebird and my Sheraton. 

But my Problem with those modern guitars always were the necks. I've had a few Ibanez guitars in my first few years of playing and while they were great quality for the price I always hated those toothpick necks.

Is there any manufacturer who uses more traditional necks for such guitars?

I really like the Jackson Rhoads Design and find Shecters really nice as well, but from the few times I played those they seem to have similar necks to Ibanez. ESPs seem to be the same thing.

I haven't tried a Charvel in a long time and cant really remember, are their necks closer to modern Fender necks or are they really thin as well?
I think I remember liking them when I last tried one."

guitar,"I have been playing guitar for over a decade, and never have I ever broken strings as fast as I have in the last week. I replaced my A string on a Monday, broke it again on Thursday. Replaced my D string on Tuesday, broke it on Thursday. Its driving me crazy. In one week, I have broken 8 strings.

guitar,"So I've been playing for about 9 months now, and I can play almost all of the songs I'm interested in learning that I find on YouTube.

I've made much more progress than I was expecting and am wondering if it is a bad practice at this point to just copy what the musicians in the videos did for fingerings instead of trying to do it completely on my own."

hi i got my guitar set up in the beginning of january and all went well. fretboard was dried out cuz of cold weather so fret edges were sticking out which was fixed.

it‚Äôs winter where i live so i‚Äôm thinking it may be because of the low humidity?

guitar,I like when my pickup selector is above the volume/tone knobs so I can get to it easier but that's not very common.

guitar,"After a few years of strictly using digital modelling through headphones (or a 40w rechargable monitor) I sold some pedals and found a bargain on this thing. 40w / 10"" speaker version would've been far more appropriate but they don't make this 100w / 12"" speaker one anymore so jumped on it when I saw it on ebay. 

Really forgot how the ground can rumble and air can move with a proper amp, it's been great getting used to it again. The vox models really chime and growl, the marshalls do the thing and the Orange seems damn good both clean and driven. Add to that an insanely good (to my unrefined ears) Diezel model and I couldn't be happier. Everything else a bonus as far as I'm concerned, those are the tones I really bother with. I pretty much discovered that I want a cleanish vox-esque tone about 90% of the time and as you would expect this really does it so well. 

Tone Room software worked fine first time too which was really unexpected with my history with guitar software. I really like the visuals and hover-hints which means a lot less time decoding what amp model/pedal options are available. Unless I'm missing something there doesn't seem to be a way to access a lot of features outside of the software but I guess that's the same as the Katana. 

Not set up my own presets yet but will check that out in the manual next - the current 8 presets are wildly unmatched to each other.

Looks like the mutt's nuts too, nice bonus!"

guitar,"So I got like $500 (Canadian) unexpectedly tonight and would like to buy a piece of gear. I don't necessarily want to spend the whole amount on it, but I'm not opposed to it either. Here is a list of my current gear along with what I like to play:

Fender 2017 American Professional Stratocaster
Jackson Pro Series DK2 Ash
Orange Rocker 15 Terror + PPC112
Friedman BE-OD, Boss SD-1, Outlaw Boilermaker (clean boost), Catalinbread Talisman (plate reverb)

I mostly play Zeppelin, Hendrix, Iron Maiden and a bit of other classic rock/metal.

Was thinking of grabbing a new pedal (no idea what I would get), but I'm also floating the idea of getting an attenuator so I could utilize the full 15w on the Rocker 15 Terror. The attenuator would also come in handy for when I get a 2nd, possibly more powerful amp head. The other option is to look for a good deal on a used amp head and buy that.

What do you guys think?"

guitar,"Hey everyone, my mom got me a classical guitar as a gift a few years back and I decided it's time to learn to play it, never touched a guitar before in my life tho. I tried looking up some youtube videos but pretty much every single creator got an acoustic guitar instead of the classical I got, so I was wondering if instead of buying a new one I could just learn to play with these videos made for acoustic guitars? Or maybe could I just switch later on to acoustic after learning classical? Is it a big change or I can play acoustic as if nothing happened? I was told classical is used more for folk and flamenco music which I'm not interested at all so do I have to buy a new one?"
guitar,"So I own two amps, a Marshall MB series for my bass (which I use a very cheap cable for) and a Squier Frontman 10G Amp (for which I use a fender cable that came with it).

guitar,"51, grew up on 80s metal, new to guitar (with a couple of false starts as a kid). I have an Epi Dot Studio at the moment, so in the spirit of ""rung what ya' brung,"" that's what I'll be using to give it another shot and try to learn.

My 12 year-old self would be appalled, but as I've gotten older, I've started to really dig country music. You know that bit in The Jerk where [Steve Martin hears ""Music in a Mellow Mood"" and starts dancing](https://youtu.be/l6AlQgq9MRE)? Yeah. That was me when I heard the entire Midwest Farmer's Daughter album. :)

So I was thinking--what might be a good first country song in that kind of vibe? If it helps, the kind of stuff I'm not into:

* Most of the ""pop"" country from the 90s through today
* Anything that sounds like a truck commercial

Stuff I really dig:

* Rootsy/Americana stuff like Gillian Welch / Dave Rawlings
* Townes Van Zandt (such a good songwriter he gets his own line)
* Justin Townes Earle (Ditto--gone too soon)
* Anything that sounds like it would be playing in a 1973 honky tonk
* Any kind of cowboy songs, from OG 1930s WPA songs to newer bands like The Dead South
* Johnny Cash/Colter Wall/other guys who sound like they're singing through 60 years of gravel and whiskey
* Margo Price / Loretta Lynn / Tammy Wynette / Emmylou / etc.
* Early Neko Case (like the Blacklisted album)
* Not really country, but I'm also a big fan of 2FTL and clawhammer banjo, so anything with a traditional Appalachian / mountain feel.

Just something I can bang on to learn some basic fundamentals and feel like I could get an easy win under my belt so I don't get discouraged. Then I can rinse and repeat until 25 years from now I'm flatpicking like Billy Strings and collecting Social Security. :)

Thank you!"

guitar,"I have a general idea of what to practice first I'm gonna practice 10-20 minutes of scales and for the other types of scales like the major scale, pentatonic scale, blues scale I'll learn how to us them and I'll go back to that in a minute. Ill learn some new chords everyday make a chord progression and use a scale or something and make a riff with that or something but I'm clueless on how to do that but whatever.

I can play like the best, but I don't actually know how to speak. I'd like to actually learn the scales that Slash uses in his [Tokyo Godfather solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km7J7uGVwlE). I can mimic that solo very well, but if I wanted to actually learn how to improvise in the scales he uses, what exactly should I look up? There are a lot of different scales and I'm still fuzzy on what exactly modes are past the google definition. I'm overwhelmed and don't know where to start. I ask that you please point my dumb ass in the right direction. Any direction or help would be greatly appreciated. I play everything from Stevie Ray Vaugh to Dimebag Darrel to Eric Johnson.

guitar,"Hello,

I have been playing the guitar for about 6 years. I have spent the last few years trying to understand how to improvise a solo or at least play what is in my head. But It always just sounds like scales. I understand how to play the major and minor scales up and down the fret board in all keys. 

When I solo I‚Äôm basically just noodling  around the scale, it sounds very limited.
I think I need to understand how to play over chord changes in order for my improvising to have more melodic.

guitar,"hi everyone. im still pretty new in my guitar journey. my goal is to play and sing at the same time.

i have a list of songs i want to learn how to play on the guitar.

lately ive been finding myself in this sort of dilemma wherein i learn a song and as soon as i get the chords memorized, mainly simple chords G/Dm/D/Am/C/Em like pop chord progressions, i get too excited to learn another song, and then another song, and then another song...

i don't know if that's a bad thing. seems like a nice thing, im eager to learn but at the same time i dont wanna be distracted by a new song everytime. and right now i have like 5 songs im trying to learn at the same time. and i dont know if im going about this the right way.

do the more seasoned players, at what point do you know that its the right time to learn a new song? is it when you know how to play the basic chord progressions from beginning to end? or is it when you can play even the harder versions of it?

also, do you put a cap or a limit to the number of songs you're learning at the same time? is 5 songs at once bit much?

but generally id love to hear your thoughs on why you prefer one over the other: learning a song and really master it first before moving on to the next song or learning multiple songs at the same time?"

guitar,"I was learning 'Zero' by Smashing Pumpkins, and there's a part of the riff where you play natural harmonics on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th fret of the low E string. 

Just for fun, I tried shifting the riff up twelve frets, and I was surprised and confused to hear what these harmonics sound like on the 15th, 16th, and 17th frets. 

Specifically - the 4th and the 16th fret harmonics produce the same G#, but the 5th fret harmonic produces an E that sounds an octave lower than the 17th fret harmonic. 

This led me to start playing every fret harmonic to try to figure out a pattern - but I can't figure out why some fret harmonics are higher octaves than others. 

Also, sometimes it seems to matter if I have my finger directly over the fret, or if it's in the middle of two frets - for example, if I'm in between fret 2 and 3 on the E string, I'll hear a high D note. But if I'm directly over fret 3, I'll hear G#. 

But I hear a B whether I'm in between fret 6 and 7, or directly on top of 7. 

Is this normal, or do I need to take my guitar in for a set up?"

guitar,"I put this together after looking for similar tools online and never finding one that was flexible enough for my needs. This tool will allow you to highlight notes in a scale on any guitar with up to 8 strings and 24 frets and any tuning you'd like. It's entirely free, and if you don't want to run it in your browser you can download an offline version for windows. Because it was made for personal use it is a bit crude UI wise, but I decided to share it anyway because there might be others like me still looking for the same thing.

[Here's a link to the website](https://guitarhelper.itch.io/guitarhelper)

Unfortunately it's not mobile friendly, I recommend using a screen with a resolution of at least 1200x600.

To the left are tuning settings. The Guitar and Bass tabs contain presets for each instrument, as well as a couple of other stringed instruments below but almost any setup with any tuning is doable through the Custom tab.

Next to it is the piano where you can modify the notes in your scale. Right of that are presets for some common and less common scales. If you can't find your favorite scale you can always input it yourself on the piano. Mode switches between all the possible parallel modes in the scale.

I hope this layout isn't too hard to grasp, my limited testing group of my two buddies who still play guitar found it intuitive enough.

I don't mind suggestions but I most likely won't make any major changes unless there's a bug that breaks it, surely this should be enough for anyone to practice.

For anyone color blind, I've tried to accomodate for it but I'm not entirely sure it's been done well enough, if you are color blind and struggle to use it then do tell me how and I'll fix it."

What pains me is the bending. My teacher says I do it correctly (using the middle and ring finger, rotating motion), but my fingers are not used to the resistance the strings provide. Maybe it is relevant that I have very tiny hands with thin fingers and that I'm a woman.

So I mostly practice to bend whole tones up starting in the 12th fret because it is supposed to be easier, but after a couple minutes my two fingers are extremely exhausted. Since two days (had a lesson yesterday) I have either dull, or slight stinging pain in the  joints (any of the three, seems to be random) of my middle and ring finger.

I guess I just want to know if anyone had a problem like that and what could help besides taking it slow. I mostly read about finger tip pain, but that is not a big issue for me.

Now I am 34 and with 33 I bought an acoustic guitar to practice in the pandemic. It's fun to strum chords but even with this a noticed a speed limit lol: trying to strum a D chord at 96bpm in 16ths is a struggle for me. Makes me wonder about switching sides and starting all again but this all would not be a problem if I embrace my limitations... the only issue being that I love tremolo picking in some songs crescendos despite not liking the idea of shredding.

I now am over the fence about trying to practice a lot of speed with metronome with different picking variations but I am skeptical about the outcomes of this. I already noticed that my right hand is much weaker than my left. While right-handed, I struggle to trem pick at 120 or 130bpm. Using the left hand, I can trem pick with much more sound definition 150bpm or more with little to no practice.

After some search on the internet I found this on 'The Gear Page' forum:

*""Interesting thing about lefties. A lot of them do not have as strong a dominance of the left hand as righties do of the right. But not all of them. It might have something to do with how the brain is wired. The speech center of the brain is on the left side in all righties and 80% of lefties, which means that 80% of lefties are not just wired backwards from righties, but 20% are. It seems that the OP is one of those left-handed people with strong left handed dominance, and no amount of practice, effort, spiritual enlightenment, or motivational speeches are going to change that. Seems like your choice is to accept the limitation in your picking speed--not that it can't be improved but it will never be as fast and accurate as your left handed speed would be--or to try to learn to play left handed. And the reason your right hand cramps is not some error in positioning or technique but the fact that you're using more muscular effort in an attempt to overcome the limitation of the left side of your brain (the side that controls the right hand.) BTW--success in teaching a left handed person to function right handed, and success in teaching such a person to go back to being left handed is very much age related--the younger you are the more plastic your brain is. People who have had half their brain removed as infants can actually learn to use the side of their body controlled by the missing side of the brain, although not normally. After infancy that degree of rewiring doesn't happen.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this is a depressing realization. I don't even know if I would be a good guitarist if I switch sides so I don't know if I should entertain the idea of insisting training speed to see if I reach any good result or start playing as a lefty.

guitar,"I was trying to get more metal sound from this AMP I just bought as second hand for 50‚Ç¨ and I noticed it buzzes really loud, it's my first amp of this size (I had only practice amp 3W so far because I lived in a flat) so I have no idea if this is normal - I'm guessing not, because the only way to play is on gain like 3/10. It sounds the same with all of my guitars and also when the jack is unplugged. Tried taking it apart, internals seems good and frankly much better than I expected, this amp seems almost brand new, checked the grounding and tried connecting external earth wire grouded right from the socket to the chasi, jack and guitar - no result. Anyone have any idea or tips what might cause this, what to check or try to fix? Thanks guys.

guitar,"Not sure if this is the place to ask so I apologize in advance.

So in our church setup, we have a mixer wired to multiple powered speakers. We have an electric guitar and I can play it directly to the mixer but the clean sound is just not good.

We are on a tight budget so I want to be sure before buying stuff so I need some advice. I'm planning to buy pedals for the electric guitar, thinking of reverb, boost, and a delay pedal. Do I need an amplifier first? I'm trying to find a head amp within our budget but I found none at the moment even after searching for multiple music stores so I figured a mini amplifier with a line output would work, like the Marshall MS2 or the Orange Crush Mini. My plan would look like this

electric guitar -&gt; pedals -&gt; amp -&gt; mixer -&gt; powered speakers  


But since we're on a tight budget and I'm a beginner on these stuff, do i need an amplifier, or should i go straight for a pedal? What should I buy first? Or are there a better way to do it?

guitar,"Im doing my second Tele build (neck and body from scratch) and want to try using the original broadcasters wiring diagram, with a lighter cap for the preset neck tone, for a more usable Western swing sound.

Has anyone used that wiring before? There's no tone so it could be pretty bright. My first build is an Esquire and depending on the amp, the no tone setting can be pretty harsh.

If necessary I'm thinking a concentric pot with the neck blend on bottom and tone on top for the first 2 settings and then the preset tone roll off for the neck.

Anyone done anything like this?"

guitar,"specifically when it is being called the ""A minor"" or ""E minor"" pentatobic scale rather than simply ""minor pentatonic"". Just experimenting/noodling I realized all 5 positions of what I learned to be the ""A minor pentatonic"" was just the notes ACDEG in that specific order. 

 Now I'm confused as to how there can be an A minor penta/E minor penta/D minor penta etc when its just playing the same notes in order? If I took position 1 of the ""Am pentatonic scale"", the one starting on frets 5-8 where the first note is A, would playing it starting from the first note be what makes it the Am Pent ? 

If I simply started from the note E on fret 7 of the A/5th string and go EGACD would that then make it the Em pentatonic? If so what's the point in having different names when it's all the same notes just starting on a dif note? Basically if it's named after the starting note then why name it at all since they're all just the notes acdeg? 


 If that isn't the case and there is some piece of music theory behind it that I'm unaware of could someone enlighten me please? I even went and learned the Major version of that position, that goes ABCDEFG just by make it 3 notes per string. just because idk why lol.


 Anyways I've been learning about and practicing scales for maybe 1.5 months now cause I wanted to learn lead to play in my friends band I learned almost a dozen positions major and minor and it seems like learning this stuff about scales just made me even more confused and now idk what I need to learn lol. I wanna learn the theory not just the positions. I wanna know why I'm learning scales, I know they super beneficial hut I don't wanna be one of those players who just learns them and hits random notes and stuff, albeit I can improvise as good as you might expect so I have def made progress from learning what I have but idk why some jams sound good and why others not so much lol.

* **Squier Affinity Series Stratocaster and Telecaster**\*: These are budget versions of the classic Fender Stratocaster and Telecaster models, and offer a great value for the price.\*
* **Epiphone Les Paul Special II:** *This is a budget version of the classic Gibson Les Paul, and is a great choice for players looking for a guitar with a thick, heavy sound.*
* **Ibanez GRX70QA**\*: This is a versatile guitar that can handle a wide range of playing styles, and is a great choice for beginners.\*
* *Y***amaha Pacifica Series**\*: These guitars are well-built and offer good playability, tone and value.\*
* **Gretsch G5420T Electromatic**\*: This is a great budget version of the classic Gretsch hollow-body guitar, and is a great choice for players looking for a guitar with a clear, bright sound.\*

guitar,"So as I'm sure you could tell from the title, I'm new to playing the guitar. I play acoustic.

I will link a video I'm trying to learn in this post. When the guitarist in that tutorial lifts their finger off of a string on the fretboard, the sound somehow keeps going and/or doesn't make a buzzing sound. For me, if I take my finger off of the fretboard to move it to another area to play the next note, it makes a buzzing sound and the sound stops coming out. This is making it impossible to learn any songs. How do I fix this? Sorry if it's a stupid question, I'm just a total newbie, and am going the self-taught route lol. Thx for help in advance!

I'm quite novice, self taught for 6 months, but I'm looking into starting a punk rock band. I'm interested in going to a guitar store and trying out the SG and the Yamaha, to get a feel for them and decide which one I like more.

Over time the injury has become easier (although the fingers still dont straighten lol). Moved to .11s six months ago, and today restrung my Tangelwood acoustic with .12 - .53 strings (Elixir).

Surprised I didn't feel much of difference in playability, which is nice, but would there be a a noticeable difference in sound quality by moving up again?

I'm a beginner looking for my first 7 string (and I'm not looking for advice to go for another 6 string, since I almost only play 7 string metal-/deathcore and prog metal tracks). I've got limited knowledge about guitars and what parts matter the most, but I do know that practice is more important than high quality gear at my level.

I'm currently playing a very old budget Strat that was handed down to me.

Furthermore, I'm also probably not going to play the sh\*t out of my ""new"" guitar, since this is just one of many hobbies.

I know that Ibanez makes really affordable 7 strings, but this deal kind of seems too good to be true. But then again, I don't know much about guitars. Can't be a scam though, since the Swiss platform this is posted on is safe and the trade would be in person.

I know Turner still make this model but they changed the wood a few years back so it no longer has that amazing wood pattern on the body. I bought the Junior Model thinking it wouldn't be as small as it was but it's just a little bit too small for my big hands lol 

If anyone knows of one selling anyway I would love to know! I've attached pictures for reference. I live in the UK but I would also consider paying for shipping from further afield.

guitar,"Hey all,

I recently got an actual, real strat (YAY!) and brought it in for a setup. The trem block/bridge needed an adjustment (it was used), and I asked the tech for a floating bridge, which I thought was a reasonable request. He made the bridge flush to the body. However, he said that it should still be very usable and similar to the floating bridge but with more tuning stability, and I followed his recommendation.

Unfortunately, I can't really pull up on the trem bar to add tension to the strings and increase the pitch. Can I fix this issue myself by loosening something? I'm thinking the springs could be loosened somehow (or a screw somewhere) to relieve tension and allow me to pull up more, as I can hardly pull up on it at all at the moment. Does this sound like something I could do myself, or should I take it back to the shop that did the work?

If someone could instruct me on what steps I would need to take and advise me on whether or not it's a good idea to do myself, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"

Hi guys, 

I‚Äôve played guitar super casually for many years (learned a song/bits of songs every now and again). I hadn‚Äôt had a guitar for a couple years after moving away from home and decided to buy one recently - I‚Äôve been playing a lot and am starting to take it a bit seriously and trying to actually learn. The guitar I bought is just a cheap Donner one, the high E string is buzzing and I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs likely to do with the set-up of the guitar. I rang the guitar store near me and they said it‚Äôs $80 for a set up. My question is, should I just get a new/better guitar and return this or should i just pay for the set-up? Would there be much difference in quality of sound between the cheaper guitar (once properly set up) and say a Yamaha FG series (based on reviews) or is it just something that more noticeable to experienced guitar players. 

Thanks."

This is the link to a picture of it: [https://imgur.com/7xG4qff](https://imgur.com/7xG4qff)

guitar,[Question]  i have a vintage guitar. The clear coat Is rubbed away in certain spots. Should I Polish those spots or will that damage the guitar.
guitar,So late Tuesday night I saw a deal on an all mahogany Fender PM-1 dread. I read some reviews and decided to pull the trigger for ~300 shipped from Amazon. The guitar arrived today and honestly I am floored. These last few months I have been going every weekend to play guitars at local shops. Specifically I have been looking for a mahogany guitar to complement my rosewood Larrivee LV-03R. I have played most modern Taylor‚Äôs and quite a few martins. And I like this fender at least as much as any other mahogany guitar I have played. It came set up with perfect low action. No buz even tuned down a half step and played hard. Even the finish is nice! I dare say the headstock inlay is tasteful. And the retro open back tuners look great and work well without slop or slipping. The neck is comfortable and the fretwork is decent. The guitar is light and resonates pleasantly when played (some Taylor‚Äôs feel dead when strummed and I don‚Äôt care for that). My only complaint is some pinging noise when adjusting tuner which makes me think the nut is not filed perfectly. I must admit I never really considered a Fender acoustic but I am glad I gave this one a chance!
guitar,"Hi Guys,

Ive recently picked up a Charvel GG USA and have noticed the tremolo arm has a pretty distinct tooling mark near the bend.

Ive asked the shop i bought it from and they seem to claim ""thats how they are"". It seems crazy for such a expensive custom shop guitar.

Does anyone else own this guitar and can vouch if this is true ?

guitar,I‚Äôve had a strato for a while and have been looking for something new
guitar,"Happily bought a mellow sounding and nicely playing Alvarez acoustic, trying to get a ballpark idea of what decade it came from, what it cost when new, and whether this model is still made.  Clues: manufactured Korea, 6 digit SN, sunburst dreadnought, maybe birdseye maple back which is 3-piece with trapezoidal middle.  Also, any ideas about the materials of the neck, fretboard, and top and whether the top is laminate or one piece?"
guitar,"Hello community! So, I've just bought a used Vox AC15 VR in great condition, I had never owned a Vox before but it was a great deal, so we shook hands and I packed the amp. I took it home and after testing it a bit I became reluctant with the so characteristic Vox tone, so I decided to put it on the marketplace. A guy comes to me offering a trade in a Marshall DSL40c, we are suppose to be testing it tomorrow. The thing is, I don't know if I should make the deal or not, I will test it and decide with my ears for sure, but I won't know how they hold on a gig, playing live with other musicians. Even if I'm not in love with the Vox, I was looking forward to giving it a go on a gig to see it growl. Either way, what do you guys think about this match up? I'm a strato player, going from Jimi Hendrix tones to jazzy fat tones to provide a good base for trumpet and sax, so I like versatility, I've actually always prefered fender amps, but now I have to decide between these two fellas. Thanks very much to everyone, have a great day!"
guitar,"Martin guitar. Always wanted one. My Grandfather had one that I loved. 

But I was curious, I know they come with higher action, can this be modified relatively easy if I wanted to lower the action?

Also is there anything about Martins people don‚Äôt tell you?

As I said my grandfather had one when I was younger, he passed years ago and before he passed he sold it. No one in my family besides him really knew anything about instruments. 

Thanks in advance. :)"

guitar,"Is it a problem if I installed a new pot but one is dime sized and the other is full sized?

To be clear, I have little knowledge about guitar electronics. I asked someone to install my new pickups, selector switch, and tone pot but they kept explaining they can't install pot since the frequency is ""too high."" so he had to ""reverse the polarity."" That part sounds like bs to me because I know for sure that reverse polarity is a word for humbuckers not pots.

Now they're saying ""if nothing works, I'll have to replace the pot with one I have here."" Think he's just trying to steal the pot I just bought."

1. Is humidity/sweat going to cause further damage?
2. What are my options for repairing it?

guitar,"Hi everyone! 

My partner has had for a long time, a Tacoma DM10 acoustic guitar that he thrifted back in college. 
This guitar is very sentimental to him and unfortunately has suffered a catastrophic accident. 
I reached out to the best guitar repair shop in my city and the owner said that it‚Äôs basically a goner. 
That the cost of a repair would be &gt; $1,000 and well above what the guitar is worth. 

I need help in finding a replacement or something better. It saddens me that I couldn‚Äôt repair the original guitar, but would love to gift him with something that can maybe fill that hole.

Ideally would like to stay under $500

Clean tone at the start of this song sue by no suits. 

The clean tone at the start of this song is this very metallic sound, at the end of the notes. I'm obsessed with this tone and need to know how to get it, i know it's the neck pickup on a tele but that's as far as know. is this technique or equipment? And are there any other songs with a similar tone?"
guitar,"I extensively use backing tracks on youtube to play over and improvise (mostly for jazz/blues). I was wondering if there exist similar videos on youtube, but instead of a track without melody, consisting of interchanging solos with some expert (N bars the expert, N bars of backing, and so on for different N), to borrow ideas from and play with. 

I used to do this with my guitar teacher back in the day and don't take classes anymore, so I feel it would be an excellent way to improve my impro skills. I feel like there has to be something similar buried somewhere on youtube."

guitar,"Hey All, apparent the r/reverbdotcom went extinct.   
I have a pedal for sale and another user on reverb. com asked me to consider a trade and preposed that we both send each other very low offers (just to cover shipping) and then send each other the pedals.   
Unfortunately, the last 2 people who actually ""purchased"" this pedal from me, never submitted payment but were pressuring me to send it prior to payment because they needed it asap and were waiting to get paid....luckily I didn't. Then they disappeared and reverb cancelled the orders.   


Is there a safe way to ""trade"" pedals ?  


My fear is, if I accept their lowball (just to cover shipping) offer and they don't send the trade, they just got my pedal for the cost of shipping and didn't actually violate the rules as I accepted the ""offer"".  


Thoughts, idea's etc ?  


Thank you"

I love this song and all of the available chords online for it are bum, hes using his thumb there to make the bar for the begining f chord but from there im a little lost.

Its important cos the song played with chords seems to be ascending in pitch but here the melody hes picking is lowering in pitch which effects how you sing it. I would really apreciate any help on the topic."
guitar,"I am probably the first one to say that ever. As I learned to start playing guitar I got a little exciting and started upgrading and adding stuff. First I wanted to experiment with effects and after a lot of research and good deal, got a Headrush MX5. But it didn‚Äôt stop there. I then decided that my little Orange 12W amp I had from several years ago when I first tried to learn needed and upgrade. So more research, and bought a Katana 100 mk2, not fully realizing that I now have 2 devices capable of playing a variety of effects. Next I wanted to play around with an actual pedal and got a Rat 2. And for Christmas my gf got me a Cry Baby. 

Is there a sensible way to make all this work together? I feel like I have barely scratched the surface of my MX5 but love my Katana and pedals. I feel like I have 3 different ways of getting effects now, and not sure if that is a good thing‚Ä¶

Some people told me to go for a left handed guitar because the learning process will be better/faster, and I'll end up feeling more easy with it, but I'm already kinda used to play with the right hand, though I think I generally use the right arm/hand for strength related things and the left one for more precision required activities. Anyway, I'd like advice. I don't know if I should invest in a left handed guitar or keep pushing it with a right handed one. Anyone ever had a similar problem? I'm confused and crying in D minor.

guitar,"I want to create a microtonal guitar and my current plan was just to add frets on a cheap guitar I already own. 

It would make more sense (in my mind) to use smaller fret wires in order to reduce crowding. However, I don‚Äôt really want to replace the frets already on the guitar. I think it could also be useful as far as being able to keep track of the different notes on the neck if the quarter tone frets were thinner. I assume I‚Äôd have to sand the new wires down to the same height as the old ones and then it wouldn‚Äôt buzz? 

Would having more than one size fret wire cause issues?"
guitar,"I have an Ibanez Jiva Junior. It has the Edge Zero II and whammy bar it came with. It came with an string action higher then Snoop Dogg, so naturally, I put it into my own hands and fixed it.

Thank you in advance for the answers and advices"
guitar,"Making this post because I was searching for opinions on this guitar before buying it and didn't find as much as I hoped, so hopefully it will help someone in the future. 

This is my 2nd guitar, I started off on a cheap one but quickly sold it once I felt like I really wanna keep learning and got this. The reason why I got it was because I love Yamaha, it looked really good, it had locking tuners, a humbocker and hard tail bridge which I really wanted. I like the simplicity of this guitar, it has all the essentials and not much more. You can still play a verity of genres. For the money it's quite nice value, maybe best in this price range. 

It did came with high action so I adjusted that and the pickup height and after that it felt good to play. Actually it was very nice and I ended up having fun with it for hours. It sounds good and even with pretty low action I didn't have buzz. The p90 is a little bit louder than the humbocker but not much, and both are good enough for me, I can't complain. One thing I wish was different is the placement of the cable jack, it's on the bottom so if you sit on the bed, for example, you have to be careful not put too much weight on it as I'm sure that's not great for the guitar or your cable in the long run. 

Now, attention to detail on this guitar wasn't amazing, there was a few scratches out of the box, the pickguard is a little bit off center etc. but this seems to be the case with cheaper guitars in general and I guess it's the tradeoff you have to make if you don't want to buy something fancier and more expensive (not that $400 is really pocket change). I just remind myself that it's for playing not for looking at it and when I get actually good at guitar I can get myself something nicer.

Thoughts on this amp? Some reviews say it‚Äôs too bass-y. Surely the EQ knob can fix that?

guitar,"My band and I are going to record our first single next weekend and the reality of it is starting to hit me. Although we've been practicing this song for about a month now there are still a few parts I feel like i am not able to play as cleanly as I'd like without having multiple takes. I'm nervous about fucking up and wasting a ton of everyone's time.

 I've been practicing the song everyday to a click but I still don't feel that I can play it the entire way through without making any mistakes so my questions are:

1. Would it be annoying to ask the engineer prior to the session to record certain riffs in separate takes to save time?

2. What else can I do to further prepare and make sure I am efficient as possible besides just practicing?

Any other tips would be greatly appreciated I am more than likely over thinking but I just want to be as prepared as possible lol."
guitar," I practiced the riffs to the Dystopia song My Meds aren't working about a week ago, which included a lot of sliding power chords around. I don't really have trouble playing power chords, but when I slide them up and down, it takes the skin off of the side of my pointer finger from the fretboard. I managed to take off like two layers of skin and am currently developing a scar from that practice session. How do I slide power chords without hurting myself like this? I've considered arching my hand more, but my hands are sort of small and its very hard to get my hand so far around the neck."
guitar,I was wondering if there would be a way to connect this 59 Bassman amp with an external rotating speaker cabinet. I understand the Bassman lacks an ext. speaker jack so I was wondering if there were any solutions around it? Thank you!

guitar,"Hi, I extensively use backing tracks on youtube to play over and improvise. I was wondering if there exist similar videos on youtube where instead of a track without melody, they consist of interchanging solos with some expert (N bars the expert, N bars of backing, and so on for different N).

I feel like there has to be something similar buried somewhere on youtube."
guitar,"Two years in as of last month, and i play mostly metal/rock. The only harmonic i‚Äôve been able to do are natural harmonics as i‚Äôve never understood pinch harmonics no matter how many videos i watch. I‚Äôm just casually playing Bon Jovi as a cool down after practicing heavier songs, and i accidentally get a high pitch and realized my index fingernail touched the string after i picked it (was at a weird angle) and i did it a few more times on purpose doing the same thing and it all makes sense now. I‚Äôve always tried to follow the ‚Äúflesh of the thumb‚Äù youtube videos but to no avail but my fingernail by accident is what opens up a new realm for me and my future guitar sessions.

guitar,Want to mess around with the looper and practice some ear training by transcribing vocal melodies. Any good songs that stick to one chord progression?
guitar,"As long as you are setting up a pedal for (nearly) unity gain, it seems like a potentially really creative practice to experiment with overdrive, distortion, and fuzz in front of say an HX, Helix, or Quad Cortex (or Ditto looper for that matter).  However, unlike tube amps that might do nice things when really overdriven, devices with ADCs have a [limited dynamic range,](https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/AKM%20Semiconductor%20Inc.%20PDFs/AK5388.pdf) above which bad things**‚Ñ¢** happen.  Is a pedal that really boosts the volume/voltage of the signal such a good idea here?"
guitar,"I recently got a SM57 mic and wanted to record my guitar amp. I have a Fender Frontman 25R. The mic is plugged into a Scarlett 2i2. Unfortunately, [there appears an obnoxious humming!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jUUNqhuyCAPkc1ho7CQQakS9PNoIe1vS/view?usp=share_link)

The humming is definitely caused by the amp because when I turn it off it disappears (there's still a hiss but that probably won't make it through the mix especially if I add a touch of EQ-ing). It's definitely a bad cable or pedal cuz nothing is plugged into the amp. It happens regardless of whether the amp is plugged into the wall outlet directly or through a power strip.

I've read that ""ground loops"" can present a problem but I'm not exactly what the loops in question are. The Scarlett 2i2 is plugged into a USB hub whose power cable is plugged into a surge protector into a different outlet than the amp... it's a lot of connections I know but this is part of my apartment desk setup rather than a dedicated studio. 

What could be the issue here? Is it a small fix or am I screwed by virtue of having to record in my apartment? If the issue is insurmountable I might have to return the SM57 and stick with just a DI guitar signal and the amp sims in Garageband :("

I already have an epiphone SG and I love it because of the long neck. I tried the strat in the shop and didn‚Äôt like how different it felt tbh. Playing higher notes feels cramped and a little awkward. 

I love how my tele plays but it doesn‚Äôt really fit my style of music (I love the strokes + Arctic monkeys + Radiohead) ((I know an SG doesn‚Äôt fit this either but I only discovered these bands after I bought it üòÖüòÖ)).

guitar,"I recently sold my Mustang Micro Headphone amp as I wanted more customizability in my EQ, Tones, effects etc, and picked up the Boss Pocket GT. I've noticed that, where I could crank the Mustang Micro Headphone amp on high-gain settings and have no noise, the pocket GT struggles. I lightly let my fingers off the string and it's quite noisey. I also think the Mustang Micro handled high-gain tones better than the pocket GT too. 
Does anyone have any experience with GT1s, GT100s, GT1000s being noisey? Is it more likely because I've introduced an instrument cable now as opposed to the Micro being plugged directly into the guitar? I'm looking into getting the Mustang LT25 because I loved the Mustangs tones."

Are there any big differences in quality or is it just that the 60s one is more 'vintage' or something.

It's also a great way to stay active and get your blood flowing if you have Raynaud's like me."

Hey,

so I just got my Yamaha C40 and unfortunately, it seems like that one was already used or just faulty in some way. It had some scratches, the box was already opened and the guitar head had some weird grease on it, which is why I decided to return it. Also, the guitar felt really cheap, so it's probably for the better I return it. I know it's a good beginner guitar, but I was surprised to find out it's incredibly light.

So, I am only looking into classical guitars, since I'm a noob and I'd rather play with nylon strings, especially since I really enjoy the sound of them. I have a budget of \~200‚Ç¨, I wouldn't want to go hugely overboard. I'd appreciate some recommendations. Thanks :"

guitar,"What's the name for that really cool sound when an electric guitar solo is doubled yet you can obviously hear that it's 2 guitars? Take the famous guitar solo at the end of ""Hotel California"" when the triplet figures start. 

I am such a poor musician with a lousy ear that I can't even tell you for sure whether they are playing exactly the same line in unison or whether there are subtle harmonies going on (or a combination of the 2).   And if they are playing in unison why can I clearly hear 2 guitars, even without headphones or nice speakers? shouldn't they sound kind of mashed together into one sound? I know there's an equivalent with ""doubled"" vocals, but doubled vocals rarely sound as distinct to me as what I'm describing with guitar solos. 

You also hear this in bohemian rhapsody in that ascending guitar figure at 5:05
https://youtu.be/_nxrYwT0SIo

And in many melodic heavy metal songs such as the famous guitar solo in master of puppets at 4:30
https://youtu.be/E0ozmU9cJDg

Could someone explain this technique to me and why it sounds so cool, and - if they are playing in unison - why it sounds (to my lousy and untrained ears) almost like they're harmonizing? And if you want to to tell me, who came up with this cool sound and what are some other famous examples besides Hotel California?"

guitar," Hi all,

I just ordered my first guitar ever: a Harley Benton ST-20HSS SBK Standard Series.

guitar,"I'm curious as to how other guitar players think of modes in a technical sense while playing. Do, for instance, have every mode memorized as it's own individual scale, or do you think of them more in terms ""I'm soloing in _ Major with a focus on _ interval as the focal point of my licks.""
So for instance, your solo in B phrygian is thought of as
G A B C D E F#  with B as your focal point (I ii iii IV V vi vii*)
vs.
B C D E F# G A (i II III iv v* VI vii)

I'm interested to hear what people think. I currently do the first option, where I'm thinking in the major key with the mode key as an anchor point for the solo. 
Is there any benefit to the latter option?

Thanks."

guitar,"Hello friends,

I have recently got back into guitar after having my mind imploded with the stylings of Ichika Nito and Tim Henson. The problem is I'm traditionally a blues/jazz player and I only kept one of my guitars; a Hofner Verythin CT with a Bigsby. I've always tried to emulate Derek Trucks so the guitar is setup a bit hybrid with higher than average action to allow for comfortable slide playing.

My question to all you lovely guitarists is... should I bother adjusting my guitar to better suit this new playstyle or should I invest in a new guitar?

I've learned Homesick by Ichika, and The Worst by Polyphia, and while they aren't too hard (at a slower speed), I do feel I could be much faster with a better setup.

Perhaps this is me just looking for excuses to shop and make up for my lack of skill/speed? Perhaps I'd be better off playing these songs on a bigger, more tense, and thick stringed guitar in order to improve my chops?

Would love to hear some thoughts."

I recently started playing guitar.
Yesterday I decided to replace my old strings with some new ones, but I found it difficult.
I followed some guides on YT. The result ended like this:

The main issue is that the thinnest string (E) doesn't seem to tune as I would have hoped. What am I doing wrong?
When using a guitar tuner (both an app and a actually guitar tuner) put on auto mode, it seems to recognize it as either a d or b. I've tried to put it on manual mode and E1. It ended up with a broken string because I tuned it up far beyond what is intended.
Same problem happen with a new string (just bought one). There is not much string to use anymore (see picture), but what should I do and what is it that I do wrong?
Everything is difficult in this beginner phase but I am really frustrated using so much time on this instead of playing.

Can you guys in here help, please? üòä"

Ideally I think I'd like a recommendation on a book to pick up blues guitar as I think this would be a nice way to learn more!

I'm open to suggestions on other methods to improve my playing and get back into it!

guitar,"Hi, I'm on an acoustic guitar and a few days ago gained the ability to play bar chords up until the 9th fret (I can't play up there yet because I don't have a cutaway), except for the F chord, I'm assuming because of the tension of the strings there. Does anyone have any suggestions for learning to deal with the aforementioned tension?"

guitar,"Hi there, 
I‚Äôm a pretty new player and wanted to get another guitar. Currently I have a Yamaha RGX121z, which I got thicker strings on for lower tunings. Sadly those strings make my Yamaha nearly unplayable on standard tuning. That‚Äôs why I thought of buying a second guitar. 
I don‚Äôt really want to cheap out and get a low end guitar which won‚Äôt make me happy in the long run. I really like the PRS SE Paul‚Äôs guitar but I also consider a Gibson SG Tribute. 
On the weekend I will go to a store and try both out. Do you think those are solid choices? Or would you recommend getting a whole other guitar?
Thanks in advance!"

I was just reading through [u/shiner\_man](https://www.reddit.com/u/shiner_man/)'s guide on building chords in guitar (thank you btw, that was soo helpful and easy to understand!) However, I think i have a question on that end. Say, you want to build the C major (so C-E-G are your triad). How would you determine which Cs, Es, and Gs to play? In just the first three frets, there are 2 or 3 replications of each note at different octaves, so I don't know where to start. Can anyone walk me through it?"

guitar,"Hi, I've been going to music school as a contemporary guitarist for about two and a half years now, actually playing for about nine. I'd say I'm pretty good! Nothing absolutely amazing or stellar, but I can play guitar. 

I've started to gig and been asked to record guitar for a lot of projects now, and when I've had at least a week's exposure to the music, whether a demo or a lead sheet, I play great. When it's a dedicated band with a well-rehearsed set list, I play even better. But a couple of times, I've walked into a studio never having heard or seen the song before and those sessions obviously go horribly wrong. I just walked into a rehearsal for an acoustic gig next week with a stripped down version of my band expecting to play the covers and originals we've already rehearsed and maybe a few more covers - the singer pulled out a completely different 20 song set list of covers and originals. I can play the chords, easy, but the singer already had that covered on her acoustic, so what was I supposed to do, just play different chords capo'd up?

Our drummer on cajon had no problem thinking up patterns and getting hits, but I was just sitting there, trying to figure out what the fuck was going on, so I said fuck it, I'm not gonna learn/arrange 20 songs in a week for $80. I walked out with the same shitty feeling that I wasn't good enough for this opportunity as I did with all those other sessions.

My question is, should I be able to just walk into sessions/rehearsals, play through the thing a couple times, and have it record/show ready? It's been asked of me so many times, and other instruments deliver, but I just can't do it and I feel like I fucking suck LOL."

I'm in the market for a new guitar after upping my practice schedule and relearning hand position and pinky discipline, pretty much a reward for getting back into a structured routine and seeing the benefits. 
I have been bouncing between a few ideas, ibanez, another PRS mainly, I play a variety of styles but lean towards the tonality of prog guitarists, John petrucci, I like the tone of modern opeth, a smooth saturated yet clear gain. I quite like the SD alpha and omega clarity. I'm all good for amps. I use VSTs or a rocker 50. 
I'm wondering whether an instrument with slightly taller frets may help my progression with speed, the frets on the PRS are dinky. 
Now this may sound like I'm splitting hairs, but I'm sure you guys get it. Heck I'm not entirely sure myself what I need at present. 

My budget is ¬£800 ‚Äê ¬£1800 ish ($980 - $2200 U.S) the 1800 is a maximum top. I would rather float around the 1k mark but I can stretch if I find something worthwhile.

guitar,"Hi everyone!

Looking for some advice, I've been playing guitar for around 15 years, the vast majority of this being self-taught. As such, I've developed se bad habits, and only that I've only picked up on recently is that I scoop the guitar strings naturally (I.e., pick at them in a very subtle arc motion rather than as parallel sweep).

I've only started noticing it becoming a problem because now that I've sat down and tried to push myself for more advanced techniques and it's getting in the way!

Now I noticed there's a noticeable buzz on a single pickup (ie, on the three selector up or down rather than both pickups). I also noticed the top two (highest) strings now don't sit on the headstock retainer anymore.

I noticed one of screws for the bridge had what looks like a ground wire attached to it. I'm also wondering if the tremolo arm sleeve itself was part of the overall bridge contributing to some noise somehow."
guitar,"I bought this Squier Affinity Tele from Thomann ( German music retailer)

I sent the guitar back to Thomann, to get it looked at.  They checked it out, and they told me that both the volume knob, and pickup noise is normal.  The volume knob noise is apparently normal for this kind of pot range, and they say that the bridge pickup has higher output than the neck pickup, and therefore this feedback is normal. They also mention that this type of guitar is not made for high gain sounds. They want to send the guitar back to me without a fix.  


I wanted to get a different opinion on this, i as i really dont feel like this noise is normal especially the volume knob pot. What is your guys opinion on this?

If I plug that one single pedal in to the amp, it makes the loud hiss.  With just the guitar, or any other pedal, or the entire chain without Secret Path, it's fine.  Plug BCCSP in, though, and ROAAAARRR.  Like a weird ocean sound.

The sound will ebb or change when I flip the switch between Secret Spaces / Spring / Plate mode, or when I turn it on or off, but it's always there.

However, it's not a bad pedal.  If I plug it into *any other amplifier*, including my Fender Supersonic 100.... no roar.

Same behavior no matter which power supply and cable setup I use.  If the Secret Path is plugged into the Hot Rod, there will be a roar.

Has anyone had something similar happen?  I love my Hot Rod and I love my Secret Path, so it's really frustrating they won't play nice together!

last time i properly played in front of someone was my gf and i remember i got real nervous and my fingers were shaking and notes were off.
it's not that i care about others opinion but it would be ridiculous if i got up and couldn't play anything.
it would be pretty cool though, i could start off with some pink floyd echoes style to lure the audience then some hendrix and page style to finish off. it would probably only last 5 minutes or so in total.

guitar,"Hey all,

Just a quick question, who here has bought instruments on Reverb before? I've only ever used it to buy a cheap guitar part before. I found a dude selling a sweet Gibson LP Traditional Pro in a neighboring state that was listed as ""pickup only"". We talked for a bit, I asked about the guitar, paperwork and proof of where it was purchased, the story behind it and why they're selling it (it was practically unplayed looking, dude said their old dad bought it and didn't have the finger strength anymore).

Everything was kind of going well except the cash part, he wanted cash only cause it was his dad or whatever selling it. I told him ""**NO**"", it's too much money to carry around in my pocket and liability (over $2k), it's safer for both of us to do the transaction through Reverb, and I feel like there's too many fake Gibson's out there. I even offered to pay half the Reverb listing free or wahtever. He answered ""sorry, deal breaker"".

I haven't answered yet but basically already decided I'm not doing that (my fiance said she would kill me if I drove cross state lines with $2k in my pocket, she's not against buying a guitar in general, just not in cash like this!).

Am I avoiding a great guitar and deal, or would anyone else do the same and not buy it? The guy's got over 100 good ratings/transactions on reverb. I'm not sure why he can't sell it for his dad on there when he's sold so many other things on Reverb, or help his dad make an account and list it. Am I being  stubborn or difficult by asking to do it that way? I don't feel comfortable spending that again with so many fake (and bad) Gibson's in the world."

Hey guys,
I‚Äôm posting because I really don‚Äôt know what to do right now. 

A few weeks ago my playing really started to deteriorate. I admit, I wasn‚Äôt playing as intensely as I was the last two or three years, but I got interested in other hobby‚Äôs and my social life changed a bit. And I get that of course with playing less your chops aren‚Äôt as good as when you‚Äôd be playing a lot, but since a month ago I just can‚Äôt play for shit. When I feel like playing I sit down but my fingers don‚Äôt seem to know what they‚Äôre doing, I‚Äôm really tense because I‚Äôm trying to get it right but you know how it goes, it‚Äôs a viscous cycle and I just can‚Äôt relax while playing. And because I‚Äôm trying to focus on my technique I just don‚Äôt feel what I‚Äôm playing at all, it seems my feel is completely gone. As you can imagine because of that I‚Äôm playing less and with that obviously nothings gonna improve, but when I force myself to play it‚Äôs not fun either. 

Have any of your experienced something like this before? Should I take a break from playing? I really don‚Äôt know what to do and it‚Äôs really bumming me out because playing used to be so much fun and now just nothing seems to work."
guitar,"I recently started relearning as a lefty due to hand injuries. I borrowed my little bro's acoustic and have put lots of time in on it. 

Unfortunately nowhere in my town has sold left handed guitars for months!

Harley Benton seems highly recommended. At 89 usd it is hard to look away. I'm curious how basswood bodies and roseacer fretboards play? 

Honestly hadn't heard of this fretboard material before. I have right handed guitars with rosewood and ebony fretboards. And have played richlite. 

Lefthanded guitars are super hard to come by in any sort or variety. 

I like everything from blues to progressive rock/metal. 

So I was hoping to get something with humbucklers at least in the bridge with the intention of installing split coil pickups down the road. 

I will probably put a ton of time into playing this guitar before I move on. I tend to run things ragged. 

Before my injury the rosewood fretboard on my righty strategy was naturally developing some personality. Is roseacer some sort of rosewood alternative?

So I have a cheaper bullet squire that I am setting up and I can't figure out why my intonation is all over the place..

So I'll get the 12th fret harmonic, fretted and open all to be the same pitch, however. If I play a note at any of the strings it comes in super sharp. As i progressed down it gets less and less sharp,. About the fifth fret is where the fretted note will be in tune and then as I work my way up past that it starts to get flat.

Should I get a new guitar that differs from my current one? (Les Paul, Tele, Hollowbody) or go for pedals or amps?

Any help is appreciated, worth noting I don't intend to gig record in near future but something I aspire to do üòÖ."

guitar,"For you metal and metalcore players‚Ä¶ what picks are you using? I‚Äôve alwys used standard yellow tortex .73mm for everything but as I‚Äôm starting to play faster and faster riffs, I find it doesn‚Äôt work as well. It feels like it gets stuck and I miss notes on fast riffs. I found a random Dunlop Jazztone 205 and I like how it feels when playing really fast riffs but it rotates in my fingers and I drop them‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never really liked Jazz IIIs for the same reason, seems like I drop them a lot.

So what should I try?"
guitar,"I have two guitars, I have ran both of them through a clean amp with no pedals. Tried two different cables but when put up gain and I tap the metal it makes the click sound on both guitars. Should I get new cables or is it just because of all the electricity in the room? Will better, more expensive cables stop the noise?"
guitar,"I decided to change strings as I got a spare set with the guitar, but both the E and A strings have snapped on me. I'm debating if it is because of the tuning pegs, but I don't know."
guitar," What  are your guys' opinions on 8 string guitars? I've been playing 6 string electric for about 2 years now, and while my music theory skills are  objectively lacking, I feel comfortable with most of the mechanics when  it comes to playing the guitar, and I can always learn the theory I'm  lacking on whatever my new guitar is. I've also been getting into some metal bands such as Erra and Sleep Token, and really wanna get something  that can replicate that style of music. I was originally gonna go with  the Schecter Demon 7 or the Ibanez RG7421PB, but then saw the Schecter 8  and thought ""why not?"" I've been a 5 string bass player for about 4 years now, so getting used to the wide fretboard and multi-scaling shouldn't be TOO much of an issue for me.

I'm mostly worried about not finding enough educational material made for 8 string guitar, since I'm mostly self taught."
guitar,"So I started with a Champion 20 and then quickly realised it didnt do enough things, so I bought into the hype of the Spark and then realised as I began to want physical pedals unbound by the spark's limitations (e.g. cant have fuzz and overdrive at the same time, etc etc) that it was gimmicky, fiddly and restrictive - especially because it has no FX loop function - so Im trading both it and the champion in and upgrading to the Katana 100, which will be my last upgrade for the foreseeable future.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I valid in doing this?"
guitar,"title says it all. trying to find something with that model. Don't really care what it is.  Just love that tone on pretty much everything I've ever heard one on.

Aside from a profiling amp because as we all know, those can have anything in them, you just gotta have someone model it for you.

thanks in advance"
guitar,The headphones slots on two of my guitar pedal type things (Zoom R8 + Line 6 POD) are broken. Everything else still works fine though so i was wondering who I should go to to ask for repairs. I asked a local guitar technician but he said it wasn't his field of knowledge. Any ideas?
guitar,"Hey r/guitar, I‚Äôm an insurance producer (salesman) working with a prospect who has 1937 Epiphone Blackstone guitar, a hand-me-down from his grandpa.

To actually insure this I would need an appraisal but I don‚Äôt even know how to quote it. I have found a few reverb postings but only two Blackstone models, both from the 40s, and the only epiphone from the 30s is like $20k

I don‚Äôt even know where to begin on this but as a guitarist myself I‚Äôm super curious about it"
guitar,"I was thinking of installing split coils on my Epiphone Les Paul classic and putting some push pull pots on. Just wondering has anyone done it and could share your experience? Do you have any recommendations for pickups? Ideally something suited for metal but not active as I'm not in love with the idea of the required modifications.

I've had the guitar for years now and I absolutely love how it feels, but I'd love to make it a little more versatile tone wise."
guitar,"So i bought a guitar and i dont know if i can relic it bcs i am not sure what type of finish it has.
Can someone help?"
guitar,Not a total beginner I can play some stuff and know some stuff but from what I hear floyd roses are a pain to change the strings.
guitar,I‚Äôm playing rock and blues mostly. Need to get new strings and there are so many string sizes. Not sure which one I am using currently.
guitar,"

So this is a really specific issue I am having but I figured might as well ask. 

I can play the Them Bones solo separate from the song really easily, however, if I try playing the whole song start to finish I find the movements required to transition from the chorus to the start of the solo to be really jank. Its just a really awkward movement for me personally. Did anyone else have this problem learning the song and is there anything I can do to make it easier?"
guitar,"Lefty playing right-handed here. I am having a hard time playing 16ths at 96 bpm strumming.

My left hand can alternate pick and strum faster so Idk if I should consider switch given my natural inclination and the low bpm I mentioned.

Also, I am 34yo, so arriving at where I am now but with the left handed guitar can be a pain and frustrating.

Your thoughts?"
guitar,I used a digital tuner and got it all tuned to exactly what it says each string should be but when I play mine it sounds so much deeper than the videos I watch of someone else playing the same song i‚Äôm trying to learn. Is this normal for a beginner to think? Or have I done something wrong?
guitar,"I feel like a total noob for not knowing about it. Don't get me wrong, I play the guitar relatively well and get a lot of compliments with my playing (even with good musicians) but I just never learned about the pentatonic scale. Is it normal to learn it late in the guitar journey?


I've never had formal lessons throughout my life and now I'm going through youtube guitar tutorials videos and going back to basics. My skills has exponentially improved. Oh how much could I have been better had I known about it sooner.."
guitar,"Hey Reddit,

I'm currently in the market for a new amp and have been considering a Yamaha THR30. My question for you is should I sell my Scarlett Solo to offset and cushion the cost of the THR30? I've been using the Scarlet Solo for a while now and have been pleased with its performance overall, but I'm wondering if I could get away with just using the THR30 as an interface.

Overall, I'm torn between selling my Solo and possibly missing out on features by selling it to help pay for the THR30. I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences with using the THR30 as a dedicated interface.

Thanks in advance for your input!"
guitar,"In other words, what techniques are widely associated with specific genres? 

While there's no rules to what a guitarist can choose to do in their own material, there are some shredding styles that seem to be favorited by artists in specific genres. Some quick examples; tapping in hard rock, power chords in punk, hexatonic patterns in metal, slide guitar in country (more of a tool than a technique). 

Or, to add another angle to the question, what techniques do you never hear in certain genres?"

guitar,"Contrary to many others in a similar question space, I've never physically stopped playing guitar. Around 3 years ago when Corona started, they immediately shut down our practice space and our band quasi stopped existing. Since then I've moved places, jammed maybe 3 times and just noodled half an hour or an hour a day to either pass the time or relax.

I played an old song I learned over 10 years ago when I started (Stairway to Heaven) and kinda remembered the joy I had learning and getting that song somewhat right. 

I've tried learning new songs, but they are either too hard (Hendrix) or too easy (any pop song). I play mostly by ear, but honestly don't have the patience to pick out notes of 3 minute solos by ear. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation and found a cure ?"

When I got it home and started playing I noticed a couple of spots at the top of the body near the neck where there was no paint.

I know that the pictures are not great (I can try to upload better ones later if necessary), but if anybody has experience with this I‚Äôd love to know if this is a common finish problem or if I should worry about possible damage.

I use a Boulder Creek (uncertain of the model) with a piezo pickup through a Boss Katana mkII 100w for gigs. Unplugged, the guitar sounds beautiful, but plugged in, it is not very pleasing to my ears, it sounds tinny and unbalanced. Which I find to be the case with most piezo pickups. I would love to hear your opinions and what you do to combat this problem. Thanks!"
guitar,"I recently got a 7 string Ibanez Gio, and I have a couple issues with it. For context, I just got the guitar a few days ago, and just changed strings yesterday. First off, the intonation seems to be off, but even if I adjust the intonation to be good at the 12th fret, it shows up around the 7th fret. Also the tuning is constantly going out, though this could be because I recently changed strings. Any help with this?

I also plan on going to a guitar store soon, so how would I check a guitar to see if its suitable? I get it should feel comfortable to hold/play, but I'm not too sure on sound (do I just check every fret/note for buzz/see if something sounds wrong?)

He's got some real expensive guitars (I mean anywhere from $600-$3500) but after something like 12 years of playing he still keeps his fingers flat on the strings and muting half of them. I know that he knows the notes/frets, but whenever I bring up technique he avoids the topic or takes the advice for one song and then goes back. I like having him in my band, but it's really hard to play with him because of this. He's also supposed to play the bass right now but he's playing guitar instead which is fine, but I can't convince him to actually bring the bass instead for once given we don't have a dedicated bassist.

 Hello, I've been playing guitar for a while and this is the first time this has occurred to me. 

I use plug-ins to play my guitar.

 I'm practicing master of pupperts, and that's when this started to happen. When I play with palm muting. a frequency between 150 and 180 hz is overpowering the sound of the guitar. the same is  happens  an octave higher.

 this frequency causes a giant noise. mostly when I left in the box I use to monitor audio. this frequency starts to collide with the metals of the sound box and creates a noise 3x louder than the video.

 I'm using Impulse Response in the plugin's cab simulator.but, when I use the neural DSP microphones. this noise is less ""torturing"", but still annoying. when I use any IR this noise gets worse. 

  I've tried adjusting the preamp's EQs and the plug-in's graphic EQ, but that changes the sound drastically. and I can't perform a smooth adjustment on the Equalizer. I have to lower about 14 dB of the 150 and 250 HZ frequencies (frequencies that the neural equalizer makes available in this region),changing the sound a lot. killing all mid-bass frequencies.

 on video it is less annoying than at home, because it is recording directly on the DAW. In my house it resounds throughout the room.

&amp;#x200B;

(I've always played metal music, but it's never happened before.)

(without the distortion this noise disappears)

&amp;#x200B;

{doubts}

Could there be a problem with the equalization?.

Is it a problem related to the guitar? (it's happening with my two guitars)

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone can help me or give me any tips i would be grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

(When i show the reaper equalizer on v√≠deo, my mouse circles the frequency that is loudest.)

I‚Äôm looking to upgrade a ‚Äò99 MIM Fat (HSS) Strat, and after looking at pickups, mainly for the humbucker, I think a [DiMarzio Bluesbucker Humbucker](https://www.dimarzio.com/pickups/vintage-output/bluesbucker)  sounds like it would be pretty rad. It‚Äôs described as ‚Äúlike a P90‚Äù, to quickly sum it up. I intend to get a splitter for this after reading about people digging it.

I personally don‚Äôt like Glen Fricker, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs a nice guy offline, but he comes across as narcissistic to me in his videos. Regardless, I think his recent videos on whether or not pickups affect tone have been interesting. The first video was a small sample size (n=4), and all of them were made by the same brand so I don‚Äôt know how much you can extrapolate from it. The second had a larger sample size, but it used different guitars so it‚Äôs once again hard to say how representative it is. 

For these reasons I don‚Äôt like that he basically says that anyone in his comments who are critical of him are anti-science. It is interesting to note though that there as surprisingly few pickup shootouts that use a) a large sample size b) the same guitar c) height matched pickups. It‚Äôs really made me wonder if all of the tone of a pickup is really just from the string gauges and the pickup height. What do you guys think?

guitar,"So I've had my guitar for like 4 years now, have had quite a few lessons and I can still only play Wish You Were Here, Trains by Porcupine Tree and the solo from Kayleigh by Marillion (badly). It's because I am extremely insecure and I have very high expectations of myself, along with a deep seated belief that I am somehow incapable of learning to play guitar beyond a certain point. Like, my brain doesn't believe that if I practice enough, I'll automatically get better. It doesn't help that I also tend to get impatient and switch to a different song before I've even learned the whole song I was practicing. All of this makes me scared of playing the guitar to the point of sometimes not picking it up for weeks/months. I guess the """"logic"""" behind it is that if I don't even try, I won't have to face the possibility that I can't do it. It becomes this huge thing in my head, and even just thinking about it makes me feel bad and guilty and it becomes a chore that I avoid as much as possible instead of something I do for fun. My brain doesn't allow me to do anything just for fun (not just guitar, anything really), I have to be above average at it or I might as well not do it at all. I would also really like to play in a band someday, which puts even more pressure on it.

I know you might read this and think ""you should get some therapy for that"" and I will, my first appointment is tomorrow actually. But I took some magic truffles yesterday and it kind of changed my mindset a bit, I played some guitar today for the first time in weeks and I really enjoyed it and I notice that my confidence has gone up a bit. So what I'm really looking for is some encouragement to make sure I keep it up this time. It would really help me if I was told that I don't have to be the next Jimi Hendrix to be ""allowed"" to play guitar, and also to hear that I'm not alone maybe? I don't hear many people talking about this mindset to the extent that I struggle with it but I can't be the only one surely. Btw, to encourage myself a bit I bought my first acoustic guitar today! Hopefully it will arrive somewhere in the next couple of days.

Thanks for reading!"

guitar,"Yamaha Pacifica 612VIIFM and PRS SE Custom 24-08. This might have been a slightly irresponsible financial decision given the state of the economy so I might return one, but man, I love them both. Saw a lot of people on this sub saying the PRS was the best guitar you could get for under $1000, but honestly, I think I like the Yamaha just a tad more. Grover Locking tuners and Seymour Duncan pickups keep it in tune better and sound a bit nicer (generally‚ÄîI feel like the PRS has slightly better sustain and you can really dial up the crunch) than the counterparts on the PRS. It‚Äôs got a 13.75‚Äù radius compared to the 10‚Äù radius on the PRS so it feels a bit nicer to solo on, but I prefer the medium jumbo frets on the PRS to the medium on the Yamaha. Yamaha was about $300 cheaper, but the initial MSRP when it released was just over a grand so maybe it‚Äôs not so crazy to think it punches *well* above its price tag.

Hi everyone,

I'm looking to purchase another electric guitar, but I cannot find anything that has the playability and feel of my Fender Strat American Pro II.

I'm not necessarily looking for something that sounds like the Strat, just something that feels like it.

I'd actually prefer something with Humbuckers to get a different sound.

I think one of the biggest things that makes the American Pro II so nice to play is the Urethane Satin neck. But, a lot of guitars are made with the gloss neck finish.

Any recommendations would be appreciated!"

this may-be a bit selfish, but, if i buy right handed, then anyone would ask to borrow it, I've seen my friend buying a good yamaha guitar which many people strummed so hard on that i could see him frustrated. so left handed may give me that privacy.

Also what actually decides the style? i mean, while writing i use my left hand, so I'm lefty, while using mouse, i use left hand while right hand remains idle but while guitaring, i'll use both hands right? so what's the distinction?

The mixer has hi-z input but tone from DI/XLR has marginally better tone imo. I'm using backing tracks too.   This is with short cable runs.   I understand now why sound guys use balanced cables over long cable runs.

The XLR connector is chunky so I see why we don't have that for mono guitar -  most people just plug straight into an amp.   I always assumed DI boxes were only for long cable runs.   I see why some amps have XLR out too.

I don't have the luxury to mic up pumping amp.

I later found this article to explain difference between TRS / XLR.  I assumed they were very similar being balanced and all.  I did have to learn new terminolgy like PFL and such but in short I wish I had bought one sooner.

I changed the strings, everything is good except the buzzing in D string around 2nd fret and 3rd too (but that might be because of wrong finger placement), I tried playing it with capo on 2nd fret and it's still there (not on 3rd fret), what might be the problem?

is there any way i can like ""hear out"" the notes?"

For example: 

Black Sabbath
Age of Reason at the 3:26 mark

guitar,"Little backstory, this guitar was previously owned by a friend of my brother, where one day maybe like 5+ years ago it wound up being in the possession ox my brother. I'm not exactly sure if he intended to leave it here or not, because I can't really remember all too well, and the dude has probably forgotten about it by now since it's been so long. My brother doesn't really care for guitar, so eventually it ended up in my room where I just assume ownership of it now.

Very very recently I've taken a tiny little interest in guitar, which has led me to wondering what exactly this guitar is. I'm a dumb little idiot on guitar knowledge, and have basically no clue as to the origin of it besides basic details I can gather from looking at it myself. I searched a little around the Charvel website trying to find some hint to what it is, but I never really saw anything listed there that looked very similar to this one. I happen to lack pretty much all of the stuff I would need to properly play it besides the guitar itself. I'm not sure if it's some sort of custom thing or not, so really any information could be of help.

My father picked this up at a garage sale in the early 80's for $50 because it has a broken truss rod. So, it's a guitar that plays well when the conditions are right and the rest of the time there's some fret buzz. He always referred to it as a Kent Les Paul but when I search Kent LP copies, none of the results I find have an unmarked head, the same ivory design in the headstock or this uniquely pointed neck plate. 

Has anyone seen one like this or have some similar LP copies that might've come from the same factory? Going off the aging of the hardware and overall condition I would guess that it was made in the 60-70's although the machine heads and control knobs were changed at some point.

(I'm certain that someone will suggest taking the neck off to look for some kind of indication in the pocket but I just set it up last week and got it playing well again so tbh, I didn't want to undo it right now since it's playing well, I gotta appreciate it when it's playable!)"
guitar,"Does anyone have familiarity with amplifiers, voltage bias and balance? 
 
I removed two tubes from an amplifier (Fender Twin 94 manual: https://www.fmicassets.com/Damroot/Original/10001/OM_leg_gtramp_94_Twin_Amp.pdf). The manual said to half the impedance from 16 Ohms to 8 Ohms which I did.  However I'm confused as to what do about the bias?  The manual indicated I can do normal operation 0.8mV when all 4 tubes are installed (and allows me to adjust it down to 0.4mV to preserve lifespan of tubes but the sonic performance may degrade).  Do I half the bias because I now have 2 tubes (range now being 0.2-04 mV) or does the bias remain in the 0.4-0.8 mV range?

One additional question: There are two speakers that are connected in serial.  If I unplug one speaker, what would I do with the impedance? Would I again half it to 4 Ohms?

I'm pretty anus at it but I'm used to teaching myself instruments and eventually I'll get better, and I'm having fun regardless.

I do sound like shit tho, so for my birthday which was a couple days ago (Im 16 now lets go) I managed to convince my father to get me an electric guitar, for recording in a DAW but also so I can practice at night or hours of the day where I don't want to disturb anyone.

He ordered me something really fucking nice, it's a MIK 50th anniversairy squire and while its technically not 'nice' i did a shit ton of research into budget guitars (i didnt want to be a financial burden) and came across it. Plus, its the same colour as my dads favourite bike and my mothers fav shade of nail polish, so there's that. It arrives today, hopefully.

Anyway getting to the point, the ashes are to arrive soon hopefully and I wanted to keep some, and I got to thinking about how i could combine her ashes with the guitar. Fretboard inlays, maybe?

My old 5 way switch sometimes wouldn't work in the neck position unless I had it in the perfect spot, so I decided to replace it. This is the only modification made to this guitar.

It wasn't until after I put the strings on that I realized that the neck and bridge pickup weren't working (or extremely dampened), and so after some troubleshooting I realized they were shorting after the pickguard was fully installed, but the middle pickup would always work flawlessly. Somehow the two pickups are shorting out when pressure is applied to the pickguard - like from the screws that fasten it down.

The switch seems like the obvious culprit, but I've re-soldered all my connections and they're all solid, so I'm not sure what is causing this because everything seems to work fine when the pickguard is flipped over, and I can't get it to short while wiggling every wire or bunching up the cables in this position - it only shorts when the pickguard is in the proper position and all the wires jammed into the cavity.

I'd sure appreciate any ideas or help."

Have tested with my other guitars and it works as expected, so I can only assume it's the output from the Harley Benton.

I've DIY'd a shim for the high-end side of the pickup by shoving a length of cable tie between the pickup and the body to raise it a little but it hasn't done anything to my ear. It's roughly 0.16"" from the strings.

I also fully detached the pickup and held it closer to the strings (this was fiddly lol), and got a very small rumble out of the octaver when I picked those two strings.

Considering picking up a compressor, but I'd rather not have another thing on my pedalboard.

guitar,"Hi everyone, first time poster here. Newbie tag as looking for subjective opinions.

I'm a long-time players of 15+ years that enjoys playing the whole gamut of acoustic/electric/bass. I'm sometimes asked by curious strangers how many instruments I play.

Now, I'm aware that anyone with a few lessons under their belt can pick up any one of these instruments and twiddle out a tune. Some may say it's silly or vain to classify them differently. And yet, there are nuances to each that require expertise. Strumming vs picking skills, dealing with higher action on acoustic/bass, a long list of electric techniques like pinch harmonics etc.

Even moreso in a band context; one requires a tasteful subtlety with bass, usually improvisation skills on electric, and a strong connection with the drummer on acoustic to drive rhythm. Many things that require different skills.

So, when someone asks how many instruments you play, what do you say?

And for those that would tell me to say 3, how far do you stretch that philosophy? Classical acoustic? Ukelele?

Thanks all! :)"

I understand (feebly) that impedance is the AC concept of resistance, so you can substitute Z for R above and get I=V/Z.

Because of having blown so many circuit breakers in my house, I can wrap my head around that.  I have a hard time wrapping my head around the concept of converting a high impedance signal to a low impedance signal without a discussion of current though.

The idea that a wire vibrating over the small magnets in a guitar pickup just doesn't provide that much current, and that one of these little active (powered) boxes increases the current available (without changing the voltage / amplitude / volume of the sound) passes the smell test for me.

Hi Guys/Gals

For the third time I will be trying my hand at guitar. The previous two times I was quite young and didn't really commit so I believe this time will be different.

Anyway, I know the basic chords and can play a few basic songs. I was a drummer for most of my life but I don't play the drums anymore, so for some reason strumming is quite easy for me, or at least the rhythm needed for strumming.

I have narrowed my choice down to two guitars but I can't decide which one to buy.

I already have an amp (boss katana mk2)

The first one is a Squire strat:

[https://www.thomann.de/nl/fender\_squier\_strat\_40th\_anniv\_w2csb.htm](https://www.thomann.de/nl/fender_squier_strat_40th_anniv_w2csb.htm)

The second one is an Epiphone les paul modern:

[https://www.thomann.de/nl/epiphone\_les\_paul\_modern\_graphite\_black.htm](https://www.thomann.de/nl/epiphone_les_paul_modern_graphite_black.htm)

I can afford either one, so the price difference does not really bother me.

On the one side I know the strat will be more comfortable and they are great value, but on the other side the les paul has locking tuners, coil splits, ebony fretboard and it's absolutely beautiful haha.

Any advice perhaps?

I know the strat vs les paul debate is fierce, and eventually I would like to own both, I just need to make a choice on which one to buy now and start my journey.

Squier 40th Jazz Bass RRM - defective knob

Epiphone Les Paul Custom Alpine White - Defective toggle switch(after researching it seems like something normal)

PRS SE Custom 24-08 - grounding issue straight out of the box

I‚Äôve had some trouble finding information on this guitar. It‚Äôs a Cort neckthrough that appears to be from the 70‚Äôs and made in Japan. There‚Äôs no serial number on it. It looks like it may have been on a sticker that was removed.

The question I have is about the wiring, shown in the pictures. I‚Äôm going to keep trying to try and trace it but for whatever reason it‚Äôs not clicking for me. I‚Äôm hoping someone might be able to help out.

There are two switches. The switch on the bridge side of the guitar is a 2 way, and the switch on the neck side is a 3 way.I‚Äôm not sure what the 2 way does. For some reason, probably due to my poor ears and knowledge, it seems like it splits the bridge pickup. The cable I have now is pretty shot, and maybe a new one will help me hear it better. 

I haven‚Äôt taken a look at the wiring on the pickups yet, but I think that‚Äôs the next step if someone isn‚Äôt familiar with this model, or this kind of switching.

G.A.S. Or Gear Acquisition Syndrome In the guitar community is kinda more fun than anything. You normally see people posting that they‚Äôre ‚ÄúGassin‚Äù for a piece of gear or a guitar and can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Because of that it‚Äôs kinda viewed as more of a relatable feeling than really anything else but this is kinda why I wanted to start a discussion about this.

I‚Äôm not saying I have crippling mental health problems by any means but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs that great. About 4 years ago I got sober from a very heavy life of partying and the impulsive habits of drinking or doing some type of drug have kind of transferred into buying things, mainly guitar gear. I‚Äôve noticed that when things get hard or I get too overwhelmed with life the G.A.S. comes back and honestly it‚Äôs kind of becoming financially bad and a touch self destructive. 

I guess the point of this post is to kinda give anyone else the platform to maybe talk about the not so talked about part of G.A.S. Also maybe to share some insights on how they‚Äôve learned to curve it, keep it under control, or even just chime in.

guitar,"Hello everyone. Last year I had saved up to buy a new guitar since I had outgrown my old Epiphone SG (which I had for 5 years). I had my heart set on a Suhr Classic S HSS in Olympic White, since I love the way it looks and I love the neck single coil sound of a strat. My local Suhr dealer, however, did not have any classics in stock, only a Suhr Modern. It was an fantastic guitar, one of the best I‚Äôve ever played. 

I had checked reverb to see if there were any classic S‚Äô at a reasonable price. There was and I was about to buy it but it sold right before I could pull the trigger. I decided to go with the Modern, despite not being completely in love with it (I feel now that when spending so much money on a guitar one should be in love with it). 

I‚Äôve had the Modern for over a year now and it‚Äôs been a fantastic work horse. It still plays and sounds amazing. But I‚Äôve still dreamt of having a Classic S in OW. I‚Äôve gone back and forth between ‚Äúthe modern is a good guitar and I should be happy with it. Who knows if a classic would play as well‚Äù and ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have settled for the Modern and just have waited for another Classic S to show up‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm not a collector, and I prefer to have one guitar that I use for everything (I get overwhelmed if I have too many options). I do however have a Shijie strat styled guitar which is great, but still not a suhr (I really want the SSC II that Suhrs have).

If I wanted to buy a Suhr Classic, I‚Äôd have to sell my modern and probably my Shijie (I could probably have some money left over if I did that, which would be nice since I‚Äôm engaged and need to save for a wedding. I could potentially make a profit and have money to put towards the wedding). 

Should I sell my modern and Shijie to buy my dream guitar? The one I haven‚Äôt stopped wanting after over a year. Or just be happy with what I have and not potentially regret selling the two I have now."

Thinking about buying a Vox AC15c1 as my first tube amp after (almost 10) years of Roland and Boss modelling practice amps.

My  strat sounds great through either the greenback speaker AC15c1 and the  alnico blue speaker AC15c1x. I do love the warm, thick sound of the  greenback but also like the slightly chimey sizzle of the alnico blue.

However, I couldn't get my humbucker guitar to sound good with either. It either sounded muddy or too hot and dirty.

Just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on using humbuckers with this amp, or if anyone has any thoughts re: the speakers? I will be playing the amp at apartment-levels most of the time too, if that influences the decision.

Thanks!

TL;DR: Looking at getting an AC15c1 with either alnico blue or greenback speaker. Wondering which is better with humbuckers."

guitar,"Hi everyone,

I need a bit of help regarding my guitar and what to do.

So I mostly taught myself how to play on and off for the past 10 years on the same cheap classical guitar that my parents bought me when I was a kid.

Two years ago, as I was getting back into playing more regularly and starting to write songs I decided to finally buy myself a nice guitar. The Seagull S6 Original Burnt Umber Presys, the body of the guitar is much thicker than my classical guitar and obviously I needed time to get used on playing metal strings.

Fast forward to today, I barely play any guitar because it feels so uncomfortable to play with it. I easily get a back pain because I put myself in an uncomfortable position to play on it. My arms feel awkward, and I feel like I never can hold it properly, either my arms feel too short to reach and hold the body or I just feel like I can't position my hand properly on the neck... 

I was told before that my classical guitar (although a full size guitar) seemed almost too small for me as I am very tall. So I always thought that I needed a bigger guitar. Note, that I am a woman, and I feel like my chest is always in the way, and can never find a comfortable position to play and sing without hurting my back or shoulder.

I need help and recommandations. I am coming to the conclusion that I probably need to sell this guitar and find another one instead. I am just very lost on which shape and size to go for.

Thanks for your help in advance!"

guitar,"I want to learn how to incorporate intervals with how I learn/play scales. Just curious if anyone has any tips, exercises, or could point me to more specific educational content to help with it.

I know all the intervals and how different scales are built on different intervals. Right now, I can play &amp; improvise the major scale, minor pentatonic, and major pentatonic across the fretboard. However, i can only do them in a small number of keys. 

I know their intervals &amp; can identify them when playing them. However, I learned these scales/keys mainly by memorizing the notes in a given key/scale. Then just playing them over &amp; over until I got a solid road map of where to go. So basically, I need to register in my mind what note I can play next, by thinking if that note falls into my memorized list of notes for that key/scale. Or by having a good understanding of the shapes and only playing notes within those. It just doesn't seem efficient to do it this way. Learning a new key of a scale im very familiar with essentially feels like I'm starting from scratch. 

The issue is that it seems extremely daunting to memorize the notes of every key of every scale. Im starting to see how playing based on intervals can do away with so much memorization. Or at least provide a better path to reaching that memorization?

I'm just curious about what I can do to get a better understanding of this &amp; get to the point where im identifying intervals instead of sticking to memorized note lists or scale shapes?"

I'm not trying to make a lot of money, I just want to pay for the storage costs.

And another problem is sometimes, i miss my strum im supposed to do. It's hard to explain through text, but sometimes my hand just misses almost all the strings i was supposed to hit. And once again my rhythm is thrown off. And some songs i just downright cannot play especially faster paced ones.

Anyways sorry if im not making any sense, im still somewhat new to guitar, or any instrument really never started playing any up till a year or a year and a half now."
guitar,"Something I was just thinking about. Is it just me or are a lot less people learning guitar/music in general these days? I know of several music schools and stores closing over the last few years and lots of people I know don't play any instruments. It also seems like guitar focused music genres like rock music/metal has lost a lot of interest too.

I know that when you go to YouTube it seems like everyone plays guitar and sounds great but I guess the reality is that this is still a very small number of people compared to the global population. Additionally, people posting guitar videos on YouTube are probably more likely to be above average players to begin with."

I‚Äôm looking to purchase an overdrive to add some grit (at bedroom volume levels) to the clean channel of my Orange Rocker 15. I‚Äôve been looking at 808-type ODs and think I want to go that route (I‚Äôm looking to get a Frusciante-like tone). Budget is wide open. 

My short list is:

- Origin Effects Green Halcyon
- Origin Effects RevivalDRIVE
- Ibanez TS808HW (hand-wired tubescreamer)
- JHS Bonsai 

Would appreciate any insight as to the best of the bunch. Feel free to add other recommendations.

guitar,"I am looking to sell some musical equipment and this will be the first time I have ventured into the world of selling musical equipment online. I am looking for opinions on what is my best route.

Sweetwater: No fees (if accepting Sweetwater gift card) and received payments can be used to purchase new equipment from Sweetwater. Low traffic/visibility to buyers. It seems to be in question whether Sweetwater offers buyer protection. 

Reverb: Fees (8.19% + $0.49). Received payments can be used for a vast amount of new and used items. High traffic/visibility to buyers.  Seems to have quality buyer protection.

guitar,"When I started playing about two years ago, I had a significant background in producing electronic music so I went straight for a plugin I could use in a DAW instead of an amp. I intend to keep it this way for now since my studio space is very small. I have both Guitar Rig and Archetype Gojira. GR is all around decent at everything and Gojira is really good for metal, but lately I have wanted to branch out my playing to more funk, blues, everything really. I'm not a huge fan of tweaking with tone - ideally, I'd love to be able to just search for a song/band and have presets to download and sound like them. NI no longer supports Guitar Rig's community library, and Neural DSP's isn't great since they have so many different plugins. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Looking for the sub's feedback on a VST that has a broad preset library, preferably community driven so I'm not buying preset packs on top of the plugin itself."

guitar,"Last year I bought a beautiful used Epiphone Les Paul Standard as my first guitar from Reverb. It was a thing of beauty of look at. Unfortunately, the thing was so darn heavy, uncomfortable, and generally unpleasant to play. So I ended up selling it and haven't had the time to try again until now. Ive done a bunch of research and it seems that Ibanez are known for comfortable guitars and I've narrowed it down to two that I like and are way under my budget (which is a good thing). Can anyone chime in on these two guitars? I think they may be basically the same guitar, at least according to the specs they are. But one is much cheaper than the other. I know I'll need a proper setup and am planning to take it to a local luthier. But I'm open to other suggestions as well.

guitar,"Hello, I want to build a guitar in the spirit of Kurt Cobain's Fender Jaguar. As I'm on a pretty tight budget, I've been searching for good deals on the body and ""boring"" parts (switches etc.) and the best I've found is this Fender Squire Jaguar. The color doesn't really match, but I'm happy with it. It's also new, so every part is there, allowing me to switch things out one by one.

However, my main concern is the pickups. Cobain used two humbuckers (DiMarzio Super Distortion DP100 and DiMarzio PAF 36th Anniversary DP103), but as you can clearly see, the one I've found is made for single coils. Aside from fitting them into the body and pickguard, would I face any other problems replacing the single coils with the new humbuckers?

Autumn Leaves is a popular song and jazz standard composed by Joseph Kosma in 1945. The song is in AABC form, which is not the most used form for a jazz standard. Autumn Leaves offers a popular way for beginning jazz musicians to become acquainted with jazz harmony as the chord progression consists almost solely of ii‚ÄìV‚ÄìI and ii‚ÄìV sequences which are typical of jazz. In this version of Barney Kessel we can find many interesting phrases and chord arrangements to be able to extrapolate to other jazz standards.

His level of passion and excitement for the band rubbed off on me some, and got me diving into their discography (and, yes, live shows- we all know) a lot deeper than I ever had in the past, when I always came to the same conclusion after a few tracks: not for me. That cool. But many years had past, and this time I tried extra hard to like them-- I really, really, wanted to--, but alas, same reaction, if anything, this time stronger- not for me. That cool.

[https://youtube.com/shorts/MBls2Qt-EBg?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/MBls2Qt-EBg?feature=share)

And I hate to talk bad about someone no longer with us, whose music clearly resonated deeply with so many, but, to me, his playing sounds juvenile- and maybe that's the appeal? I don't even know how to further articulate it, or expound on ""juvenile"", but that's all I can think of. It's so loose and careless, but he clearly cared. Ditto with Trey of Phish (and Phish in general, though I can tolerate a lot more of their music)- it kind of sounds like a lot of silly, light, bouncy, nothingness with not-so-masterful (despite what so many claim) guitar playing. Oh, and hearing John Mayer with Dead &amp; Co. is even more cringe for me- it is like the sonic equivalent of a vanilla chai latte. Totally safe, anemic, uninspired, tired, lame. Boring.

I actually feel bad, in retrospect, bringing Phish into this, because I actually managed to get into some of their stuff- i.e. I have actually been quite into Hoist. Their music, while still light, airy, energetic, silly?, in nature, seems more ""serious"", which might just be my hangup in all of this- that some of this music is too fun sounding?! That's a crazy notion, that someone would hate that- but therein is the subjectivity of the listeners experience.

guitar,"Hi fellow guitarists!

I would like to brainstorm some ideas with you. I'm researching music history related events and the guitar has a lot of influences that helped shape music throughout the years.

This is part of a concept app I made about music time travel. It allows you to go back in time and discover music from any year among learning about the major events. For example, if you are browsing the year 1967, you would get a ""fake ad"" about the first Wah-Wah pedal ever released. Like shown in this picture ([https://imgur.com/a/zxJ0q3N](https://imgur.com/a/zxJ0q3N)). Or an ad for Gibson's Maestro Fuzz-Tone which was the first distortion pedal released in 1965 and used by Keith Richards on the Rolling Stones' Satisfaction riff.

What major events/technologies/records related to guitar do you think were highly influential? (Anywhere between 1960-2010).

I just received this wonderful jv modified 50's stratocaster. It's basically a perfect guitar! I hope to post a review soon for anyone interested. In the meantime I was going to set up the bridge to be 'dive only' but thought why not explore the tremel-no. I have a few questions:

1. Has anyone tried the tremel-no on a strat or just in general? I've read lots of feedback in both directions and am curious to hear about your experiences
2. I haven't been able to get in touch with the company to determine which one is the right fit for my strat. I tried searching their website (none of the images match) and emailed them but the email was invalid and even tried texting them (# listed on their website) but no luck so far. Any ideas how else I could figure out compatability?
3. My main concern is being able to rest my palm on the bridge without the guitar going out of tune (as it currently does while fully floating) - are there any other potential solutions other than the tremel-no? I could throw a wooden block in there but love the idea of being able to switch back and forth when the inclination to use the whammy bar comes up

Thanks in advance!"

guitar,"I've been playing for \~20 years and can generally pick up a song fairly quickly.  But whenever I learn a song with Travis picking -- specifically songs with alternating base lines (thumb going string E - D - A -D) -- I have to take it really slow and basically learn the song measure-by-measure or note-by-note. 

I've finger picked for a long time and am comfortable using three fingers for the melody lines, and when a song has a steady E-string base line (e.g., delta blues type tunes) or just alternates between 2 strings instead of 3, my brain can handle that just fine and my focus goes to the melody.  But with those alternating base lines I have to break it down almost to the point that it's unnatural; as in I'm almost memorizing that my thumb hits the A-string before X note within the melody and the D-string right after Y note.  I'm a pretty novice piano player and I equate it to how I feel learning the left hand base/rhythm and right hand melody.

I assume that there's a point where a really experienced finger picker can hear an alternating base line song, and understand the base line relatively easily and dedicate their focus to the melody lines (and do so without really thinking about the base line and how each note of the melody fits within it).  I can't picture Tommy Emmanuel spending more than a few minutes getting the essence of a song like that down (obviously even seasoned pros can spend tons of time perfecting/personalizing a song). 

**My question is are any of you at this point, and if so what was the 'ah-ha' moment where you realized the base came naturally and you could focus on the melody? Or are these songs just always a struggle?**"

The screw hole on the pickup itself seems to be stripped out but the screw won‚Äôt come out at all effectively trapping the pickup in the pickguard at a fixed height. I tried heating it with a soldering iron, using sheer force. Nothing.  
Is it gooched for good? Worst case scenario I‚Äôd imagine if just have to get a new pickguard and pickup but obviously I‚Äôd rather fix this than replace it.  
Luckily the pickup functions.

Any tips are appreciated"
guitar,"I would like to get a single coil guitar mainly for funky/clean stuff.

It looks like the main stream guitar are fender strats or tele.

However I would like to have it as natural wood colors, and if possible some unique shape like ormsby guitar(the SX model). 

I ever want to get a split coil, but seems after some searching on Internet that split coil give a total different tone to a single coil. So I may not want it as humbucker with coil split.

Appreciate if anyone can advice for such guitar choice and if they can purchase oversea. Thanks :)"

guitar,"So this happened tonight... yesterday I got a message from a youth pastor asking me to play guitar on stage for junior youth that was happening the next night. I only received the songs that we would be playing at 12pm the next day (the day of the performance) I get home from school at 4pm, so that only gave me 1.5 hours to listen to the songs for the first time, learn the strumming pattern etc. The original keys of the songs contain many chords that I don't quite know by memory yet so I decide to capo and change keys assuming that the singer would be fine with that. So I arrive to the performance sorta knowing the songs but not really super well. Thankfully the singer says she is fine with the keys that I chose at home prior to arriving.
We go through each song once before the kids arrive and it goes semi-well for the most part considering I had only heard the songs for the first time less that 2 hours ago... So come time to preform, the singer has decided we were going to now play along with the music in our earpieces. I don't think it's a big deal until the sound guy comes up on stage with new music for me that matches the music in our earpieces. And to my surprise I don't know more than two of the chords found in the songs. So there I am standing on stage with music I had never seen before for a song I had heard maybe twice in my life (all in the last 2 hours) as I was about to preform in 10 seconds. Obviously since I couldn't play the chords I couldn't really do much as the singer was now basically doing a solo (it turns out the bassist had the wrong music lol) So yeah I kinda just stood there awkwardly strumming random muted chords as I‚Äôm sure the kids got a kick out of it.

Anyways, that is my story/rant. If anyone could give me some advice on what I could have done differently to have a more successful performance that would be great. I also really hope this doesn't kill my interest in guitar since I think it is a very valuable instrument to know."

guitar,"Hey all,

I‚Äôve been playing guitar for the better part of 20 years now. 10 years consistently when I was younger in bands and consistent lessons and 10 years intermittently learning on my own and playing by myself. I‚Äôm not as good as I should be and would consider myself firmly intermediate.

I‚Äôve found myself playing a lot of acoustic over the last year or two and really want to spring for a new (to me) acoustic guitar. I‚Äôm coming from a basic $200 fender acoustic-electric that I‚Äôve never liked, but got on a deal 15 years ago. I love a deal and I am confident in what to look for buying used, so I‚Äôm inclined to go that route, but this time, I want to buy something I love!

Here are my criteria: 

1. My budget is $750. That doesn‚Äôt mean that I want to or have to spend $750. You‚Äôll notice my list later probably goes down to $300 or so on the low end.

2. I do not care about electronics. I have no ambition to gig. I like to play for my wife and around a campfire, but that‚Äôs just about enough of a concert for me. I‚Äôd much rather my budget go toward a nicer playing instrument than the electronics.

3. I don‚Äôt care about names. If someone walks into my house and sees it hanging, I don‚Äôt care that they recognize it‚Äôs a Martin or Taylor or whatever. In fact I‚Äôd rather not pay the premium for those names.

4. I‚Äôve historically preferred the tone from mahogany or cedar acoustics, but I‚Äôm willing to try anything as long as I can hear it in person. I‚Äôve never really liked the tones of a low end Taylor for example, but I‚Äôd still like to try their new Academy.

5. And these are super minor and nit picky, but I generally prefer simple design, natural colorations, no pickguard, satin finish. This point is totally negotiable‚Ä¶ if I fall in love with a guitar that‚Äôs glossy with a pickguard, so be it. Also, don‚Äôt care about the cutout‚Ä¶ take or leave.


I‚Äôve been in the research phase for about a week and compiled this list of models or families that I‚Äôm considering. I prefer options that I can play in a store readily, but I‚Äôve been tempted by the Orangewood options available‚Ä¶

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm planning to play in no particular order:

Eastman e2om

Yamaha AC3M

Taylor academy

Orangewood Ava

Seagull S6

Yamaha LL16

Martin X line

03 series larrivee 

Breedlove pursuit or wildwood


Does anyone have suggestions to add to the list or have additional input on any of the guitars listed? I just want to make sure I get a side by side of the best guitars at this price point so I can make an informed decision!


Thanks in advance!"
guitar," I'm not talking about amplification, I get its to reduce feedback when its plugged into an amp. I just mean without any gear, just the guitar on its own. Can it simply be used to just dampen the sound of the instrument is an environment where the guitar might sound louder?"
guitar,"I picked up guitar back in 2014. I bought a BC Rich Bronze off Amazon for like 80 bucks, learned how to play tab and did that for years. Eventually, probably a couple years ago I kinda fell out of tab and just started 'noodling' as people call it. Eventually, this lead me to want to write my own music. I started but found that I was really just playing one shape up and down. It sounded good to me, but every time I wanted to add in like the next part I just couldn't, honestly I still can't but i've learned some of the basic chords now primarily GCEAD.   


Yes I know your jaw is probably agape saying I probably just didn't play that much but in those 8 years except for a few days i've played the guitar for at least 30 minutes every day, and although when playing in front of others I seem like I just barely picked up the instrument 6 months ago, I am a farcry from when I started. I guess my discussion topic is has anyone else been in my shoes? I know a lot of people are self taught, guitar lessons are expensive and I work two jobs. I know that progression isn't the same for everyone, my brother surpassed my playing ability in about a month but he's a prodigy and has a perfect ear naturally.

Picked this up for what seemed like a pretty fair deal today.  The serial number indicates it is a 2006 deluxe stratocaster, but I am not finding anything that matches this guitar very well.  The pick guard and pickups are replacements I believe and are Fender Custom Shop Texas Specials.  It has fender locking tuners, a roller nut (I think maybe added on later), two point tremolo bridge, abalone fret markers, and based on the weight and other similar models I am pretty sure it is a mahogany body.  Nothing seems to quite line up with it in 2006.  There is a similar model from 2004 and an SSH model in 2005 that were both FSR.  Anyone have any ideas?"
guitar,"Last year I bought a PRS 24 SE that has 85/15S and I love them. I play finger style, and there is so much more dynamics and character with how my fingers pluck the strings compared to my emg's.

My emg's have been the best during recording in my bedroom studio - I record like 3 feet away from a computer. The 85/15s are fairly noisy, I can use the middle pickup selection only with a noise gate that is passable for recording.

I want to try the Fishman Fluence Tosin Abasi or Modern pickups with 3 voicing options in a headless guitar, but I've read a lot of mixed reviews on reddit - everything from having to return and exchange faulty parts to the pickups being dull/thin. The emg's I can swap out really easily because they are solderless and I know they'll work flawlessly, but I would rather have that nutcracker tone even if it means spending more time soldering - mainly play cleans to thick overdrive, copious amounts of modulated effects, not much into metal these days.

What are your experiences with fishman for recording? Can I get great dynamics and zero hum?"

guitar,"Hi all, I've been playing acoustic guitar for almost 3 years and am at the point where i would like to record my playing. 

I exclusively play fingerstyle and like to challenge myself to play harder arrangements including ones by Sungha Jung and Andrew Foy but i also play easier arrangements aswell. When playing, i sound fine however, when i listen back to my playing, i cant help but notice there are so many imperfections in my playing which make it hard to enjoy - for example: scratching, accidental notes, string buzz, off-beat playing etc. It seems that no matter how much time i put into practicing, my playing just doesn't sound clean enough for recording  - even when playing the most basic songs!

Is there something i'm perhaps missing? Maybe a playing technique or post processing effect which would make my playing sound better? Are they maybe exercises i could do to improve my accuracy and timing? Should i be using a metronome? What action should my guitar be set at for fingerstyle playing? 

To record, i use one of those cheap amazon condenser microphones and a Behringer UMC22 thingy. I use FL Studio and mainly apply light reverb and EQ. I notice that after recording, the waveform seems very 'thin' and 'spiky' as opposed to full - could this be because my picking technique is poor?

I bought this used guitar last summer from my local guitar shop. Over the last few weeks I noticed these lines that look like cracks near where the neck meets the body.

guitar,"Hey guys, I recently was recommended Stringjoy strings to put on my acoustic (Gibson Southern Jumbo), he put on the phosphor bronze Foxwoods strings. Immediately strumming the guitar I could hear something was wrong. The strings sounded new, yet somehow lifeless and dull. Before the string change I had done tons of testing and determined this guitar sounded significantly better than my other acoustics, yet immediately after the string change my opinion immediately changed and the guitar sounded horrible in comparison to my less expensive guitars.

Also, they've gone dead and dull within two days of playing on them. This is a coated string, why would that happen?

Doing more research to find out if anyone else had this experience, and I found it really weird that no one has anything bad to say about these strings. Their site has no shortage of 5 star reviews, and plenty of review videos on YouTube that say the same thing. Does no one else find it odd that it's almost impossible to find someone who has something bad to say about these strings? Has anyone else had this experience?"
guitar,"So, I'm a 16 year old guitar player and I've been playing for around 2 years on the acoustic, recently I've gotten pretty good at the guitar (In my eyes). My favorite bands are Polyphia and SOAD. I listen to a lot of Polyphia though and really like their sound.

I think it's time for me to get an electric guitar. (I have an amp ready I got one a year ago)

I decided on Ibanez because I like their sound and feel, (I've played one at Guitar center once)

But I'm torn on weather I should get an Ibanez Jem Jr or something with a better bridge. I know the bridge is one of Ibanez's worst, but I feel as if the beautiful fret inlays and the monkey grip is blinding my judgement.

I have no problem with replacing the Bridge later on, (Can I have suggestions on what Floyd rose bridge I should replace the old one with?)

A contender is an RG.

(I would like to buy either one used)

I really think the look of my main guitar is important to me, the better it looks the more likely im to pick it up and play it.

The closest guitar center to me is 3 hours away so it isn't really an option unless I happen to be in that area like the last time i went to guitar center

Today, a lot of rehearsals are just done with in-ears and line-ins with various amplifiers etc. making it so, if you're not plugged in, all you hear is the drums and a person singing at their own comfortable volume without pushing.

With most venues having a PA system and whatnot, is there actually a need for 4x12 cabs etc anymore? What is the biggest and what is the smallest amplifier you'd use for any band situation in any venue?

I'm leaning towards Harley Benton because they have some solid top guitars that fit my budget, but I'm open to any suggestions. Oh and by the way the Yamaha FG series is completely out of the question because I can't any FG used or new where I live, I don't know why though. They just seem to be scarce in my country. Oh and by the way I'm around 6'3 (long legs and neck :))."

guitar,"Guitar for low-tuning setup

I‚Äôve been looking around for a new/used axe to keep in C-Standard/Drop-B for sludge/doom/stoner/metal stuff. Really don‚Äôt want to spend more than $500 since I might have swap pickups and/or the at for setup. I use fuzz more than distortion usually. I have some options, any other recommendations welcome. Thank you for your time.

Don‚Äôt really matter but some cosmetic preferences:
-24.75 scale
-set neck
-inlays 
-humbuckers
-I don‚Äôt mind heavy guitars (a touch more sustain?)
-Double cuts
-Gloss neck

Epiphone SG- not sure what model is modern or best suited. Plus these come with Alnico pickups stock, which I‚Äôve been told, may be too hot/bright for my personal taste. Custom Epi-SG can go for less than $500‚Ä¶

Epiphone LP- I‚Äôve seen Custom‚Äôs for less than $500 particularly the Silverburst (Adam Jones style) model. Maybe a LP Standard will be decent? I don‚Äôt know much about the Probuckers that are now in most of the Epi‚Äôs‚Ä¶.

LTD Viper- you can find some good deals used. This is the guitar I‚Äôm less familiar with, but have played at shops. I have no idea about the stock pickups on these things.

Harley Benton DC-DLX or Custom- Bass player friend of mine ordered one and I thought it was great for the price. Pretty curious about these but wary of ordering a guitar I‚Äôve never played. Hope the neck feels good. Watched some vids and people say they have good weight to them. These pickups would mostly likely be swapped and setup of course, which might end up making it more expensive‚Ä¶ who knows.


Again any insight/advice/recommendations is appreciated, thanks."
guitar,"When he was be playing he'd hold the guitar up with one hand while holding the note. Got me thinking, surely he isn't doing that with heavy guitars. Then it got me to thinking, one of his more plain (less skulls etc) ESPs would be a cool guitar to try out. Not really sure what the objective of this is, but hey, if anyone has tried an ESP, can you confirm they're light?  


I have a Suhr Strat, and it sounds great but yeah I would like to see how much lighter an ESP would be like Kirk uses"

guitar,"Hello, I recently got a stratocaster, but the middle and neck pickups are not working. I tested the pickups with a multimeter and a cable and they both showed extremely high values so I opened it up to check for any loose cables and they all look fine so I'm figuring there's something wrong with the wiring connections.

Am I getting scared over nothing?

Thanks"
guitar,"Hi. I upgraded some parts on my floyd rose special (all saddles, sustain block and a locking nut). I did this because I had problems with tuning stability. After a full setup the guitar pretty much stays in tune perfectly but now the sustain is non existant.

Some things I suspect may be causing this:

* the new sustain block is 2mm shorter than the original one
* I had to file the locking nut because it was too high and it's not perfectly leveled to the neck
* the strings I put on were opened for a few months - it was a 7 string pack and I only needed the 7th string from it so the rest was in a drawer (in the original packaging though)

Does anyone know if any of the issues I listed may be causing the sustain problems or could it be something else?"

guitar,"I just bought a used PRS. So far, it looks great. Plays like a dream. I‚Äôve wanted one for a long time. 

However, the pickups leave a lot to be desired. I already knew this when I bought it and I am looking at the prospect of buying humbuckers for it. I usually like a warm, throaty bridge humbucker And a bright and clear neck pick up. 

I was leaning towards the Seymour Duncan custom custom in the bridge and jazz in the neck. 

What do you guys think? Does anyone have any different recommendations for this? I‚Äôm particularly concerned about the bridge being too bright, as I pick heavy and find most bridge pickups to be too shrill and unbalanced when paired with a neck pickup, especially one as bassy as those on many PRSs. 

I play pop, rock, jazz and country. A little bit of everything, but no extreme metal tones needed."

guitar,im new to the guitar and i was wondering whether i should mute the chord after playing it so that it doesnt ring out when i switch to a different one? is it a bad habit to not do this? when should i be muting notes? i read that when doing a scale you should mute with your finger the note that you played by releasing until it mutes. thats why the question popped into my head about playing and practicing my chords.
guitar,"So I‚Äôm trying to learn some of these songs before I get the official score to Legally blonde. I was using this video to help me:

https://youtu.be/n1Ds-i3I4b0 

Unless I‚Äôm completely stupid, these are in a half-step different key. The thing is that I learned other songs in Legally Blonde from Dave Bannen (the guy in the YouTube video) and it was in the same key as the official recording. 

I don‚Äôt know which one is ‚Äòreal‚Äô. Can anybody help me figure this out?"
guitar,"I‚Äôm looking for some thoughts/advice on my next guitar. I already have an Epiphone Les Paul Traditional Pro IV, a Squire Classic Vibe 60s Strat, and a cheap Fender acoustic/electric. I‚Äôm still learning and taking lessons and still kinda suck. My favorite music to listen to is hard rock and metal, but I find myself playing slower blues mostly. With my skill level and the fact that I‚Äôm a basement player and will not be gigging, I don‚Äôt need high end guitars.

These are the guitars I've been looking at.

* Firefly FF338: I've always dug the look and sound of semi-hollows.
* Firefly FFLX: I already have a double humbucker solid-body, but Explorers just look sweet!
* Harley Benton TE-52: A T-style would complete the ""trinity"" of guitars with my Les Paul and Strat, but I'm not sure there's any other real reason to get one other than the different tone from the pickups.
* Harley Benton JA-60SB: It has P-90s, and I've never used those, but it would be a different sound that what I already have, and P-90s sound cool.

There‚Äôs also an Explorer kit on Bargain Musician I‚Äôve had my eye on, and it costs about the same as all the others."
guitar,I just got one on reverb for a great price and have no idea why. My understanding is it‚Äôs basically a DSP 4000 (which is basically an upgraded H3000) with ins and outs for guitar rigs. Why is this thing going for so much less than its less guitar-friendly siblings from the late 80s to mid 90s? What‚Äôs your take on this unit?
guitar,"I'm back to playing guitar after an extended break so my guitars were out of touch, out of tune.

I checked for their tuning and intonation and two different tuner apps on my Android phone showed slight variations to the tuning. This makes me wonder if mobile app tuners are accurate. One of the guitars is a floyd rose and its intonation is quite messed up so I'd like a tuner that gets pretty close to accurate. 

If not, what are some good tuners that won't burn a hole in my pocket? I'm from India, so everything imported is expensive. Thank you!"

guitar,"I currently own a jackson dinky js32 and a blackstar id core 40,i don't like the sounds at all. I'm not sure if it's due to the amp or the jackson stock pickups.

What do people upgrade first from budget gear?"
guitar,"I'm using 10-46 strings on my strat style electric guitar at the moment, and I find that I break strings quite often. Would going up to 11-48 or 11-52 be less likely to snap while bending? I know it takes more strength but I don't like breaking strings. With the higher tension from the strings, would they snap easier with bending, or would the extra thickness make them less likely to break?  


TL;DR,   
Do thicker strings break less often despite the increased tension?"

guitar,"Hi there! I just bought my first proper guitar. It's a Epiphone 2021 Inspired by Gibson SG standard in alpine white, and I got so excited getting it that I immediately went home and played it, not even bothering to ask the guys at the store. After looking at a few videos, I saw the Epiphone SG muse on youtube, which had the same Alnico Classic Pros that my SG has.

guitar,"I'm a newbie with sound tech stuff and have run into an annoying problem. Thanks in advance for your help!

My setup: Ibanez AZ42P1 guitar (got it November 2022 new) plugged into a Focusrite Scarlett Solo, which is plugged into my mac running Logic Pro X with some NeuralDSP plugins.

I was recording some stuff last night, and bumped into something gently (probably my desk? lol). Since that moment, I hear a loud electric buzz whenever I'm plugged in and the guitar volume is nonzero.

I tried swapping cables‚Äîdidn't work. I tried playing straight through the plugins without Logic‚Äîdidn't work. I tried playing through a physical Marshall amp and the buzz wasn't so noticeable (there was a bit, but not significantly more than my strat). The buzz persists with all pickup settings (power tap on and off, too). The one thing that makes it mostly go away is setting the tone knob to 0.

Any ideas on what might be up? The only things I can think of are (a) the connection between the Focusrite and the computer got messed up (looks fine...) and (b) a gentle bump somehow messed up the electronics of the guitar, which would be sad.

Any advice on what this might be? Thanks!"

3. picking 1234 through the hole guitar neck up and down
4. 3x3minutes hammer/pull of with every finger (or as long that I can feel ‚Äùburn‚Äù

Ezra Koenig

As a teenager I grew up on a steady diet of 00s guitar bands, most of them now unlovingly lumped under the label of ‚Äòlandfill indie‚Äô. Most weeks my pocket money would go on copies of Q, NME and occasionally Total Guitar. Guitar bands were still topping the charts. Reading the review sections of those music magazines, you might have been duped into thinking that nothing of great artistic merit was being created outside of the traditional guitar band set up.

Come 2023, the pendulum has well and truly swung. Poptimism is gospel. No one thinks twice about giving serious critical attention to the latest releases from Beyonc√© or Taylor Swift. When Jay-Z headlined Glastonbury in 2008 there was uproar from the curmudgeonly old guard; when Kendrick Lamar and Billie Eilish were announced as last year‚Äôs headliners no one batted an eyelid. Things have moved on, for the better. Guitar-based music still makes up the bulk of what I listen to, but when I find myself most excited by something new and innovative, there is often little or no guitar in earshot.

This all means that guitar music can feel like a dying art form.

With this in mind, I have thrown together a playlist of reasonably contemporary guitar music, hoping to show that there‚Äôs life in the old dog yet.

guitar,"I've been playing for almost a decade and still don't know what order to put my pedals in!
There's 5 total. I believe the order should go as follows:
Tuner, Lo-Fi/compressor, Turbo Distortion, Overdrive, Reverb

guitar," I bought a new guitar less than a month ago, and after a break of a few days I tried to play again. When I am playing open A, G, B, or E strings, the sound is muted. The problem also occurs when pressing first fret, but does not occur on any other fret. However, the weird part is when I tried to play while the guitar was laying down on the floor, it worked normally. I made completely sure I wasn't touching any of the strings, and everything seems clean on the guitar. The guitar worked fine for a couple of weeks, until now when the problem occured."

guitar,Hey guys newbie guitarist here. I‚Äôm looking to replace the tuners on my epiphone special ll GT.( les Paul with a fender style trem )The stock ones don‚Äôt hold a tune at all compared to my Ibanez and I‚Äôm honestly not looking to spend a lot. I know you get what you pay for but I‚Äôm hoping there are some decent quality tuners I can replace that are on the cheaper end. Also a replacement nut recommendation would be appreciated too!
guitar,"Hello guitar community! I bought an used cordoba c10 recently. I was told that it had the bridge reglued but on closer inspection I noticed two sticks coming out in the bridge area inside the guitar which makes me question the procedure taken in the reglue process and if it would affect the guitar in the long term .. but I‚Äôm not very knowledgeable when it comes to this stuff so any help/comments are appreciated.

guitar,"I don‚Äôt have to play for very long before my wrist begins to hurt. I‚Äôve recognized that this is probably due to the placement, but for some reason there‚Äôs always drawbacks no matter how i try to fix it. It could just be because I‚Äôm new, but whenever I try to position my wrist straight, my elbow awkwardly inches away from my body, and often hurts either way. I just need some advice ‚Ä¶. ^^‚Äô‚Äô 

Something a little less important however is how I always press on the wrong string and it just doesn‚Äôt make any sound (with my left hand). I then have to weirdly move my palm forward then up so I don‚Äôt accidentally press on the other strings and make sure I‚Äôm able to reach towards the others. but I think that‚Äôs just how I lack experience. 

For example I press D on the third fret, and if I want to press B on the fourth fret i have to accessibly move my palm forward which then causes my wrist to hurt..

The part that hurts is the joint that‚Äôs right under the thumb and a little bit along the thumb as well. Or it could be that I simply don‚Äôt stretch enough‚Ä¶.? Sorry for over-explaining."

guitar,"Hi, I've been playing guitar for about a year and a half and I still can't wrap my head around how to do pinch harmonics even close to consistently. I listen to a lot of bands like Gojira and Pantera so a lot of their songs call for them but I just end up getting frustrated and skipping those parts. Is there anything I can do to practice hitting them consistently or with the right technique?"
guitar,"Hi all!
For the past year or so I've been struggling with my right hand technique for tremolo/speed picking. I've been playing for almost 15 years already, and only recently when I signed up for some classes for the first time, I realized that my tremolo picking technique was completely wrong. Due to that I've never been able to play fast, at least now I know why.
Well, my teacher said something on the lines of ""I know what you're doing wrong, but I don't know how help you correct it"", and I've been trying all sorts of things.
I've had the most success when trying to pick fast by sort of rotating the wrist, as if I were strumming but really fast and with a small amplitude. I don't have much control over it though, and recently I realized that past a certain threshold (around 70bpm playing 16th notes) I involuntarily start moving my thumb to pick, instead of the wrist. After some time it hurts a bit and it doesn't really feel right. Any tips on avoiding this kind of movement?"
guitar,"So for the past year or so, I've had chronic pain in the furthermost joint on my index finger of my left (fretting) hand. It only hurts when pressure is applied to it, but it does frequently impact my playing technique.

I've tried not playing and resting it, but if that helps any, the pain always comes back. 

Has anyone encountered this problem? What can I do about it? 

Thanks!"

guitar,"hello everyone, 

i picked up the guitar for the first time at age 15, and after a few ""show me how to play this"" style lessons with a couple different teachers, where theory was never discussed, i kind of just found my own way. 

now, aged 33, i'm a pretty good player, but with a lot of holes in my playing. i have zero theoretical know-how, and the simplest of concepts (major, minor, chromatic, scales) goes way over my head. i don't even really know what harmony is. any music i've written, any lead lines i've played, just a series of happy accidents; a result of messing around on the fretboard. 

but i'd really, really, like to change all that, and start learning theory, start progressing as a player. i've got a very solid feel, and i know could do great things if i applied myself. 

i've spent the past two days learning/memorizing the notes of the two low strings, and have about got them stuck in my mind now, but what next? a friend suggested i learn their octaves next, so i'll do that.

once i learn all the scales, what do i then do to start playing? do i just randomly skip notes and rearrange the order, playing within the scale, or is there some method to what i'll play? 

anyways, i'm just curious what you'd recommend for me to start. i want to dedicate 1-2 hours a day just to learning theory. please remember i have trouble focusing and absorbing information, and have zero theory knowledge now, so i really need a simple, foundational, place to start. my ultimate goal is to play jazz and classical, but to also apply the knowledge gained to all other areas of playing. 

thank you kindly in advance!"

guitar,"I recently purchased a used American Professional II from a local shop and at first, it had terrible tuning stability. It was priced right, so I thought I could resolve the stability issues an add a nice American strat to the collection. I figured the issue was because I went from 9s to 10s and the nut was binding so I took it to my favorite luthier who did some nut work and put on locking tuners. Now, it stays in tune very well for normal playing and pitch down on the bar, but if I even lean my hand on the bridge for pitch up, it starts going out of tune. Bar pulls completely throw it out. It has a 2 point trem with 3 springs with higher than factory tension installed by the luthier as well. 

What else could I do to improve stability on bar pulls? Replace the nut? Try lubricants? I've never had this issue with a 6 point and this the first Fender I've had with a 2 point so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

guitar,"Hi, I‚Äôm an absolute beginner. I‚Äôm left handed and have been wanting to learn bass and/or guitar for months and lately I‚Äôve been looking around for a guitar. I was at a guitar shop a few days ago so I could a feel for both instruments and see which one I wanted to start of with. I played both right handed and left handed and neither side significantly uncomfortable. I‚Äôm unsure if I should just play it safe and buy a left handed guitar/bass or just buy a right handed guitar/bass. I‚Äôm not opposed to learning left handed but I‚Äôd prefer to learn right handed because right handed guitars are more accessible. Any advice?"
guitar,"I play in a band and in practice we were playing an oldies medley. It was Oh Donna, Angel Baby, and a few other similar songs. We played in C major, so the chord progression was C, Am, F, and G. I did a solo using the C minor pentatonic scale because the songs are kind of slow and gloomy. However, the keyboardist said it sounded off and I should use the C major pentatonic instead since we were playing in C major. I switched to the major and he said that sounded better but it just didn't sound right to me.

So my question is, can you use the minor pentatonic scale over a song that is played in a major chord progression? I was under the impression that you could do this and it depends on the tone of the song. For instance a blues or slower song would go great with a minor pentatonic and a more upbeat song would go with the major pentatonic for a solo. If I'm wrong I'll accept it and solo with the major pentatonic to this song but I want to check with other musicians first because it just didn't sound right to me."
guitar, I've been playing some songs lately that are originally played on  piano/keyboard. It's a great way to break out of old habits. One thing I'm finding is that these songs have a lot more 4ths in the melodies as compared to music written on guitar and this is where my fingers tend to get crossed up. This is not necessarily in an arpeggio (where you are fingering the chord shape) or a 'punk' chord  change where the power chords are just going down one string (ex C5 to  G5). Rather it's trying to find the best way to play fluid sounding melodies with some 4ths thrown in. I've seen some players rolling the  finger onto the next string but that doesn't feel quite right. Any suggestions on how to play 4ths more fluidly?
guitar,"I'm recovering from a broken arm and noticed that some positions that were trivial before are really hard for me now, like the following example:

guitar,"So I(13) have played guitar for a few years but only recently have started practising a lot more. My goal really is to be really great by the time I'm about 18. I don't do grades but I'd be about grade 4 I think. I see lots of questions ""how much practise per day is enough"" but I kind of want to go the step above that. I listen to a lot of music, I love guitar and could happily play for a while each day. So what I'm asking is how much practise a day would make me over a few years start becoming a really good guitarist above average for my age kinda thing. I don't really do theory I just do songs and stuff but my other question- Is there any theory or technical things I should be doing in my practise or is just playing lots of songs enough? Sorry if that sounded bad I didn't really know how to explain it."

guitar," Hey  everyone, so I got a guitar this Christmas it's a Squier '50s Classic  Vibe and I'm having a blast with it. I decided that, before I throw away  all the plastics and boxes that came with it, I should let a friend of  mine that knows more than me about guitars try it out and see if there's  anything wrong with it (in case I want to return it).

He  played it for a bit, and said that the guitar seems great but he did  point out that the 5-way pickup selector sticks out of the guitar and is  a little stiff. He has a similar guitar to mine (Squier '70s Classic  Vibe), and his pickup selector is much smoother when it comes to  changing positions, and I looked at it and I did notice that my selector  pops up a lot more than his (the metal is much more visible).

The  selector works just fine though and changes pickups perfectly, I'm just  wondering if this is something I should be worried about or something  that I can fix. Maybe it's just a quirk of the guitar and nothing to  worry about. And maybe the stiffness will go away the more I use it.

I  also notice that it detunes rather fast but I'm attributing that to the  fact that it's new and the strings are the ones that came with the  guitar so maye not the best. The pegs are a little loose too? Is this  normal? I think I might be overthinking it though.

Thoughts? Thanks in advance.

TLDR: The pickup selector piece of my guitar sticks out more than normal, wondering if this is a problem."

\- Take the electric and play on the sample created, apply effects **only** on this stream with the in-built amp effects

I  went to a store, the seller told me that the amp could apply the  effects on both the looper stream and the elctric guitar stream, but if i  plug the looper in the ""aux"" jack input (you can see the jack input  with the ipod icon on the amp picture in the link), according to him the  amp shouldn't apply its effects on it with this method.

However, I am completely inexperienced with pedals. I was thinking of getting a Line 6 Helix but it seems that the Mooer GE300 is about as good for a fraction of the price.

2) Since this will be a big stage and we'll be moving around a lot, would it be recommended to use wireless systems for my in-ear and my guitar? Or will it be better to just be wired with something like a 30 ft cable? if cabled is the way to go what size cable would you recommend?

IMPORTANT NOTE! - I am completely ignorant when it comes to tone, gear, etc. The guys I play with handle all that; I'm just good at guitar and that's what got me the gig with this band.

guitar,"After some help with my Jackson Mick Thomson soloist that seems to have constant static. I've tested a different cable, continuity is fine on all parts of the guitar - checked with multimeter, no loose wires, tried wiping the guitar down with a dryer sheet and playing in a different room and power socket. This doesn't happen with my other guitars on the same amp. 

Can't figure out what would be causing this. It seems to be completely fine for maybe 1-2 minutes of playing, then a constant sound of static will creep up. Guitar is still playable, but there's static in the background. Will not go away when I touch the strings. 

All my other guitars are passive pickups, could it be the actives causing this? But this was not happening before from what I remember.

I'm not exactly sure where to start. I know most people learn chords to play along with songs, but that's not rly my main goal. How should I start? Are there any things I should learn/master first for the electric quitar? Any steps i should take?

I would really appreciate some advice or some personal experience stories. I always get hit with the ""just practice"" : (I just want a little more detail Thanks in advance! (lowkey inspired by bocchi)"

guitar,"Hey, I am learning acoustic guitar for some time and at the point where I am pretty good at playing songs but my fav genre is more towards rock and alt rock where electric guitar is used.

guitar,"I decided to change the tuners out on my Jackson but I've run into a couple of problems. 

One of the problems is that one of the mounting screws is very stripped out.  Like to the point where it is completely rounded out. I tried using a rubber band but I didn't have any luck. What would you guys suggest I do? 

The other question I have is one of the tuners has proven almost impossible to loosen and remove. For some reason it's really tight and it's like I can't even get a good grip on it compared to the others that came out with no problem. I was thinking of using some WD-40 on it and seeing if that helped but I figured I should go ahead and ask others before hand.

Thanks in advance for any advice. If I need to clarify or explain something feel free to let me know. It's late when I'm writing this so it could be entirely possible I've forgotten or overlooked something."

guitar,"Hello, in about two weeks i will be travelling to europe, and because of the price it would be far cheaper for me to just buy an electric guitar there than buying it where i live. My question would be if its a safe thing to do, if i could carry it with me, and if it would fit properly in the overhead. I assume its going to be a big plane, since i will go from Italy back to South America. Sadly, buying another ticket isnt an option because the tickets are already selt and there isnt any more space.

guitar,"I got a B Stock Jackson King V JS32 for Christmas, and when I went to tune it up, I noticed most of the strings on the first fret were very close to the fret, especially low E, and G and B in standard tuning. B was pretty solidly stuck on the first fret when I started. I tried looking up how to fix this, and the manual said to adjust the Floyd Rose using the allen screws near the bridge humbucker, which I did, and that helped a little, but it still hasn't entirely solved the issue. The action on the strings gets higher the closer your hand is to the body, while there's very low action towards the head. 

I saw a suggestion online about adjusting the truss rod, is that what I should do?"

This is a video I've recorded where it is very apparent.

I've tried so many different ways of combatting it but it continues to make itself present in my recordings, even in the DI. I've tried changing guitars, strings, interface settings, EQ'ing it out, and so many more solutions that I've seen online, and nothing has helped.

guitar,"Hey yall, 

I've been playing guitar for 2 years now - I've picked with my hand floating the entire time around the neck pickup as I've found that pushing my arm back any further strains my shoulder. However, my pick accuracy and alternate picking aren't that great. I know some people anchor using the bridge, but my shoulder keeps straining me. Pinky anchoring isn't much help either. I'm self-taught, so I'm thinking I might just find a teacher who I can book for one lesson so I can figure out this technique issue, but any advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated."

guitar,"Hi everyone,

I have been playing for 19 years, since I was 10. I don't know music theory but can read tabs and basic stuff like knowing a basic major and minor scale.

For the longest time, I've been stuck in my guitar playing where I know I can shred if I want, but it'll be up and down using the minor or major pentatonic scale, do re mi fa so la to do, etc, and it feels kinda bland. Especially if I wanna improvise. I feel like I'm hitting the same pattern and notes that I know of. And it's very hard to think outside of the box since I'm very comfortable and used to this scale. Doesn't feel unique at all. And i don't know the scale/chords relation as well. If i wanna improvise, I can kinda 'feel' hitting the right note if straying away from a single minor pentatonic chord on the fretboard. Other times, I'll hit the wrong note. 

Any advice where to start to break this habit? Maybe I have developed a bad habit or something. I recently purchased 1 of the Tom Quayle legato lesson to test things out. But I feel like I'm just memorising what I do. Maybe it'll get better and have effects on my playing ability in the long run if I keep myself disciplined and just learn it (it's kinda boring to be honest)"
guitar,"I'm looking for a headphone amp/audio interface type device. Im in an apartment, and cannot play through my amp due to volume restrictions.

guitar,"Hi guys  

I started to take my playing more seriously this year. I‚Äôve been playing guitar for a long time but now I dont know I just wanted to get better.   

Its hard to describe my level at guitar playing level. Imo my hardest solo what I can play 90% right is Lamb of God grace intro solo. And yesterday I learned to play Enter Sandman solo without wah with 80% speed in one hour.  

I practice efficiently 30-45 minutes per day with metronome  

My routine (best description with my english) 
1. alternative picking 

2. Triplets 

3. picking 1234 through the hole guitar neck up and down 

4. 3x3minutes hammer/pull of with every finger (or as long that I can feel ‚Äùburn‚Äù 
5. Something new or jamming w scales    


I am motivated with this but kinda worried that will this kind of guitar workout take me anywhere.

Lately, when I play my guitar, doesn't sound good, sound like without tone, in example with distortion, sound clean, but when I play strong the strings the sound is nornalized, you can listen the sound already, if you play smooth or strong the strings, sounds well.

guitar," 

Recently started teaching guitar and one of my students is an elementary aged kid, so no older than around 10. Its getting increasingly difficult to teach him and make him pay attention. I noticed during our first lesson he seemed disinterested and talked to him a bit about it. He told me he wanted to play guitar because he thought it would be cool but now has no interest in playing as he finds it boring, it hurts his fingers, and his parents are forcing him to go to lessons. He doesn't listen to any bands/artists and isnt into any genres of the sort. Everything I show him he kinda rushes through and has a strong ""Are we there yet"" attitude through the whole lesson, just waiting for it to end. I initially considered talking to his parents about it since its affecting me as well as its very frustrating to teach him but he said he wouldn't like me to and I don't wanna get him in trouble with his parents or anything. Its also hard to teach him things because of how physically small he is, its hard for him to play properly, to use proper fingerings, and play chords.

Any tips whatsoever? Im thinking about doing another lesson and seeing how it goes, then talking to his parents about letting him stop"

Here's a bit of back story just for venting. I would appreciate it if you read it and maybe share ur thoughts 


I'm a self-taught guitarist, sadly not a good one, but I'm trying my best to improve, I spent the first 6 years with a shitty guitar(the one my parents agreed to buy since they believed am not really into music and guitar , it's just a phase, the whole shebang), it was tough learning on an instrument that pushes against you, however when I got old enough, had my own job, I bought myself a new really good guitar, that was Nov 2021. I've learned and recorded one full song by Jan 2022, but since then.. for one whole year, I've been stuck in the current piece I'm learning. Guitar is a beautiful and hard to master instrument, and i love everything about it, but Self teaching is getting frustrating, really."

guitar,"Hello! First post on here, sorry if i make any mistakes or if the post isn't appropriate! Anyway, about a week ago the wiring on the output jack on my les paul copy (vintage v100 by wilkinson/john hornby skewes) came undone and needed to be resoldered. Which is fine but at the time i didn't have access to a soldering iron, nor the time to do it, so when we had band practice i just brought my old squier bullet strat instead. I immediately noticed how much EASIER the strat was to play compared to my les paul copy. It has 10s on it and so does the LP but for whatever reason playing the strat feels effortless and the strings feel like 9s and a lot slinkier, whereas my LP feels very very stiff and uptight with the same gauge and brand strings, which to me is weird, because ive heard quite a lot that les paul style guitars are supposed to be extremely easy to play and a strat you gotta fight a little. upon closer inspection of both guitars i noted that the fretwire on the LP was really really low and kind of squished kinda like the ""fretless wonder"" frets although not that low of course, and the strat had more narrow but tall frets. the LP also has a beefier neck. So, i guess my question is: is that a normal thing (my lp feeling so stiff and hard to play compared to a guitar with a longer scale length) and what advice would y'all give me on making my LP play more smoothly? Thanks in advance and cheers."

I read that this is the only coil splitting configuration that is possible using a standard 5 way lever. Is this true? And how are the lever positions even configured then? This is somehow not specified in the diagram.

And finally, how do I identify which contact of the lever in the diagram corresponds to the contacts of my actual lever in the guitar? üòÖ.

Hi, 

I have been playing guitar for 12 years now. 6 strings normally, but in the last 2 years, I've bought 2 basses, a bass amp, and a multi-effects pedal for them. The problem I'm having is justifying keeping them if I don't play them as often as my 6-string guitars.

guitar,"I have a Stratocaster that I really enjoy playing. For many years, I didn't use effects so things like pickups were never something that I learned much about.

Lately I've been playing different styles like rock/metal. I don't have many issues with my humbucker guitar. However, every time I try using any form of distortion/gain it always sounds bad with my Stratocaster (hum/buzz etc). I know that single coils are not ideal for this, but is it normal for it to just sound terrible?

I see all sorts of people playing rock stuff with Stratocasters. Have all of these people upgraded their pickups or is there something else I'm missing? Would it make sense to just replace the bridge pickup with a humbucker while keeping two original pickups? If I replaced all the pickups, would it even sound like a Stratocaster anymore if I played clean tones?

I do occasionally like the Stratocaster tone but I can't decide whether it makes sense to upgrade the pickups or just buy something like a cheap Ibanez RG for rock/metal stuff."

When plugged in, there is an audible hum/buzz from the amp. It gets louder when the tone POT is cranked up, and is loudest when the volume POT is in the middle; happens on both neck and bridge pickups. It goes away if volume POT is at max and tone is at min.

If I touch the strings, there is no change.

If I touch the pickup, goes away completely.

If I touch the metal around the selector switch, goes away mostly.

If I touch the lead jack, goes away mostly.

If I touch the metal on the lead - at either end - it goes away mostly.

I‚Äôm going to try a new lead and see if thats it, but before I go chasing down a fix, i want to see if this is normal. I am also going to grab a multimeter but am not exactly sure what to test (other than the resistance on the lead).

I‚Äôm hoping its not a grounding issue with the guitar."

Hello everyone,

I got this guitar my father inherited from a deceased friend.

It would be Interesting to find out more about it. Correct me if I'm wrong but from my research I found out it's a Guitar from Kay. It's worth mentioning that the 1st fret is not marked and the tuners for the G, B and E Notes seem to be reversed (with reversed I mean that you have to turn them the other way around from any other guitar I have played with). Also the fretboard seems to be a little lifted as seen in the pictures.

The Strings seem to made out of copper but I am not certain on that. It has a great, loud and clear sound but for me (a beginner) is hard to play.

Sadly the guitar is a little damaged as you can see in the pictures.

Sorry if some of my phrases are hard to understand, english is not my primary language.

guitar,"I used to swear by Tortex (delrin) but went acrylic a few years ago and I  love it. Bright sounding and precise. Only drawback is that they are pretty slippery.

I tried metal but I think it wears the strings fast. Also tried wood but it had too much friction IMO."

guitar,"Hey, so I just got a Fender CD-60s acoustic from guitar center. I'm a total beginner, so I just wanted a basic first acoustic. 

Now, I've read a lot about getting your guitar setup when you first get it. As a newbie, I don't think I'd know enough to do a thorough set up my first time. I was thinking of getting it taken in somewhere. But my guitar is new (not used) and I read on guitar center that all the guitars they ship from the factory actually do come set up, though the intonation can get thrown off during shipping.

If all that's needed is a little tuning, I figure I can just buy a tuner and do that myself. Or, would you guys still recommend I get the guitar checked out anyways in case more is needed with the setup? I'm of course willing to do that if it's needed. But I just don't want to blindly go into the shop not knowing anything and then I end up spending money I may have not had to. Thanks in advance. Look forward to the journey!"

guitar,"Hi,¬†

&amp;#x200B;

I've been looking at ways to have all sorts of sounds on a guitar, like organs, violins, pianos, etc. 

It appears that if a hex pickup is used, a signal is sent to the computer. But I would like to send it to a pedalboard, add some effects or loop sounds, and then send it to a regular guitar amp.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this possible? What are the options?

Maybe something like Boss SY-200, but top of the line, latest and greatest, with best tracking, most sounds... Even better if it doesn't require hex pickup."

guitar,"I've heard this phrase, or variations of it, like 'I like a guitar with bit of a fight' or 'It seems the guitar is fighting me', what does it actually mean when players say that?"
guitar," So - I've been playing (on and off - a lot of off) for 30+ years. 

I've been in cover bands, mostly rhythm guitar, but doing some lead in my latest band, and we're even doing some originals. And the explosion of content available online - much of it for free - is nothing short of mind-blowing. I remember trying to get instructional videos on VHS when I was a kid! Now there are so many amazingly talented players and instructors on Youtube, it's crazy.

And yet - I haven't really gotten good at the things I'd like to get good at. I mean, I'm not horrible. But I'm definitely not a 'good' guitar player, particularly in terms of lead playing. More than anything, I would *love* to be able to whip off tasty improved lead licks, [like this guy](https://youtu.be/fLlU9FVbwls?t=420).

I generally understand in my head where to play - what I can't do is get my fingers to play as fast while still staying in sync with my picking hand. And yes, before people ask - I've spent *years* doing the 'play it slowly at first and slowly increase in speed'. For whatever reason, I can never get to anything *close* to 'advanced guitarist' speeds.

Just one example - I love Bernth's channel, Interesting guy, great explanations, and lots of interesting exercises. I started doing his '[guitar speed' exercise](https://youtu.be/ngw-XyB4zZ4?t=110) some time ago.

It's an exercise, starts out at 50bpm and ratchets up 10bpm every time through. After *months* of working on this - I can kinda sorta do 100bpm but it's not really all that clean. If I'm being honest, 90bpm is the max. Sweep picking? Bwahahahaha - im-effin'-possible.

So I'm starting to think that maybe fast leads / sweep picking and such are skills I needed to develop as a kid when I could have played for hours on end, and it's simply never going to happen for someone closer to retirement.

Does anyone really have real-life examples of adult-age players that have actually expanded out of the 'box' / slow speeds, and developed into accomplished lead guitar players?"

The bridge is fine, but when I‚Äôm on the neck pickup it‚Äôs totally quiet, and then when you move the guitar or hit it with your hand, or you strum a big chord it springs to life! And then when you adjust your sitting position or lean forward it dies again.

Is it a faulty pickup? Is is a bad soldering-job? There is no access to the electronics on the back of the body so all the work needs to be done through the f holes.

Thanks for reading and have a good day!"

guitar,"Hi

Let's start with the obvious; I'm a beginner and I'm relatively tone deaf and ""effect deaf"" if that even is a word. 

The thing is that i bough a blues driver BD-2 some time ago and as my first pedal and I'm loving it. Recently I've started to play som Hendrix. Well... Trying to play some Hendrix...

The thing that I've noticed is that the BD-2 sounds pretty darn good as a Hendrix/fuzz pedal if I turn up the gain a lot. I'm on a Les Paul if it matters.

This thread is 50/50 on being a genuin question and just a general discussion. With that being said, am I really missing something important by sticking with the BD-2 instead of a proper fuzz pedal. 

I live in the forest and also have relatively shitty computer speakers so answers like ""just try/listen to it yourself isn't that helpful"".

I guess some would say to just buy the cheap Behringer fuzz pedal and try it out but I'm not the richest guy in town so that's not an option either, despite it's low price."
guitar,"The way I‚Äôve been able to make a lot of progress is by playing along with the Justin Guitar music app. I learned as many chords as I could (G, A/Am, D/Dm, C, E/Em, Fmaj7)
And now I use the app, basically like Guitar Hero. I just listen to the song and find the strumming pattern first.
The reason I think this works for me is because I‚Äôm being shown when a chord change is coming. But I can also look up the chords in a song, write down the order they‚Äôre in, and keep up without much struggling. 

Is this ho anyone else learned?

I don‚Äôt know music theory or anything yet but I‚Äôm doing pretty well with my method.

One thing I‚Äôve noticed is when I play along to a song, sometimes I lose track of the right pattern and start strumming exactly with the words. Any advice on how to work on this? 

Also, I‚Äôm not sure how to begin to improvise or work on individual strings. I want to be able to ‚Äúshred‚Äù. Do I have to have an electric guitar? I play left-handed and it feels like the strings on my acoustic are overly hard to press down on the first/second frets. For instance, I can‚Äôt learn a real F chord or B because of this. 

Any guidance is very much appreciated!"

guitar,"Hello everyone,  So I made a guitar. The look is not good since this is the test version but the sound is good enough. I brought it for playing live in a rock bar and people quite worship it, not on the look of course lol. I am upgrading a better version of it.

guitar,"The guitarist/YouTuber Jim Lill made a [video][jl] a year ago that changed my mind about tone in electric guitars ‚Äî not that I really had made up my mind ‚Äî I had assumptions absorbed from playing for many years that proved wildly inaccurate, probably borne out of the genuine differences between *acoustic* guitars.

This got me to rethink a lot about that nebulous term ‚Äútone‚Äù. Does it just mean timbre ‚Äî the relative amplitude of each harmonic and the shape they make in the frequency spectrum?

Let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs the case. We can just take a short snapshot in time, analyze the spectrum, and that‚Äôll be that. However, a note will sound different at attack versus decay, sustain, and release. So how wide should our window be that we look at ‚Äî just a couple milliseconds out of the decay? Should we focus on the transients in the attack? What about how long the sustain is with and without feedback?

If we go with a couple milliseconds out of the decay ‚Äî tone might be in any of these:

- the type of attack
- the point of attack on the strings
- the strings themselves
- the pickup placement
- the pickup type
- the cable length
- the effects before the amp
- the tone stack including preamp and power amp
- the effects loop
- the speakers
- the shape of speaker cab
- the shape and texture of the room

Which part of that chain dominates the others? Is it at the very beginning, with the fabled fingers and picking/fretting techniques? Is it near the end with amp and cab? Is it somewhere in the middle with the electronics and the length of the cable? Any guitarist‚Äôs tone that we didn‚Äôt see play will have been recorded ‚Äî how much does that shape the tone?

As we widen the window, other things are going to play more of an influence, measurable things like vibrato, intonation, and feedback, along with those intangibles that we chalk up to *feel*. Keep widening it and we‚Äôll eventually arrive at note choice and melody composition, even entire albums or shows. If we keep expanding that window, we‚Äôll be examining the entire body of a guitarist‚Äôs work. At that point, how many of the above things actually matter given that most guitarists have used many different guitars and effects and amps and recording methods?

~~~

All of this tone chasing is enough to drive any guitarist crazy. But I have discovered the secret, the inevitable conclusion, the one thing about which we should all agree on: Tone is in the notes that you don‚Äôt play.

I have never had this on any other guitar, not my Suzuki classical guitar, which had a broken bone saddle!!! Which I never knew until on NYE, when I realised it was not supposed to lie down!

Now the weird thing is; everytime I tune my Gemini I, it detunes whilst I tune it, and even weirder - I have tried 2 strings, and they detune at the same note...

It has come loose once, though not broken, I have tried to tune it again but the same happened.

I have kept the strings loose in a bag for some time, already tried on the Suzuki, but then placed in a bag, because the bone saddle of my Suzuki broke in half, which I didn't thought anything of because I've always had the bridge lying, not standing, which is not the way it is supposed to be.

Does anyone know why this happens? Thanks!

Bonus question: why does it say: 'United States Government Property - DODDS' on the back? Thanks!"
guitar,"Now I'm not a newbie to recording, I've been doing it for about four years now and I'd say I've gotten to a point that I'm pretty happy with. But for the life of me I cannot get my guitar tracks to sound like what I hear on my favorite modern metal records, or even records from 20-40 years ago. The issue isn't that I'm using bad equipment, my rig is a Peavey 5150 into a Marshall 1960A cab miced with a 57. I've tried all sorts of mic placements and amp settings but every time the tone just ends up sounding thin and scratchy, and I can never get it to sit right in a mix. The only explanation I could think of is that my room is bad for recording, but at this point, I'm not sure if it's that or if I just suck at recording guitar. For those of you out there that have recorded metal guitars before, is there a certain technique that took your recordings from mediocre to next level that I'm missing out on? Or anything else of the sort? Thanks"
guitar,"I've got two guitars lying around that I don't use often. I desperately want an electric and am wondering how much I could fetch for these two in order to pay for it. 

Both have minor cosmetic wear, but necks are straight. The Yamaha is hard to tune; there's presumably a problem with the tuning pegs but those are easy to replace. If y'all have suggestions for some decent (around $15-30) classical pegs it'll be helpful.

guitar," 

I have a classical guitar, Fender Gemini I, bought it from a thrift store, the (only) problem it had was a broken tuning mechanism (one peg gone), guitar is not broken at all, and I bought and installed a new tuning mechanism on it, though, skipped some screws (the 2 in the middle) because I couldn't find the holes.

I have never had this on any other guitar, not my Suzuki classical guitar, which had a broken bone saddle!!! Which I never knew until on NYE, when I realised it was not supposed to lie down! (Have the guitar 4 years or so); Only when I picked it up after a few months, the strings started to make a weird sound...

Now the weird thing is; everytime I tune my Gemini I, it detunes whilst I am tuning it, and even weirder - I have tried 2 strings, and they detune at the same note...

guitar,"This is hard for me to talk about...

After many years of hard work and practicing (I've made it a habit to play for at least 20 minutes a day and watch 1 rick beato video to help with advanced stuff), I've still gotten nothing from this damn instrument. When I bought my first Gibson I'd assume it wouldn't be too difficult... needless to say, 6 years and many more guitars later it's not working out. 

I'm a high income earner and am pretty rich tbh so the money spent on guitars isn't a problem. But despite my continual efforts I still get confused over basic chords, even the ones I learned years ago. In The past I tried to deal with my frustrations by panic buying more expensive guitars but thankfully I've stopped now. Any advice?"
guitar,"I am not completely a beginner, but it's been like 8 years since I've gotten my hands on a guitar. However, in the past couple of years, I've had the zeal and passion to get back into it but couldn't really get it to my parents because of the expenses.

However, thanks to my good performance in college, they allowed me to get a guitar, leaving me in a bit of a dilemma. My budget is roughly around 20K INR or around 250USD at max (please remember that import taxes and stuff are pretty bad here)

I'm a fan of both black metal and deathcore and would like to play both.

For the longest time, I wanted to get an Ibanez Gio GRGR131EX (mostly because of its look, but also the 5-way switch, which would help with variety), but it's not available anywhere in my country, and all the shops I visited told me that it wouldn't be restocked anytime soon. So if I were to get one, it'll take me months.

On the other hand, I have thought of Jackson JS22-7 (suggested to me by a professional guitarist). It grants me with one extra string but not the tonal options, and now I don't know what to go for.

Is the extra string worth it, or are the two extra options for pickup switching one gets with the split humbuckers? Would the learning curve be different if I were to go for the 7-string? Please suggest to me some other models you think would fit my requirements perfectly."

guitar,"Rant: On

In the last month I've had 5 kids come to me with the same guitar and asking me if I would give them lessons. I wanted to say ""Yes"" to every one of them. Unfortunately I had to turn them all away. 

You see, the issue is that the instrument they brought to me was so poorly and cheaply made that they were unplayable. They also were unrepairable. I know this, I'm also a luthier. 

This happens every January of every year for me. Parents have children asking for a guitar for Christmas. Well meaning parents aren't certain that their child will actually put in the time and practice to learn. As a result they don't want to spend much on an instrument. They go online looking for an inexpensive guitar and they buy the cheapest thing they find with mostly positive and good reviews. (Perhaps the real question should be, ""Who is giving all of this junk good reviews?"") The guitar they end up receiving is a 3/4 size piece of junk with a bowed neck, no truss rod, plastic bridge, frets that will cut you, strings made of zinc alloy, and tuners that slip more than a toddler on ice. Also, what does intonation mean?

If you play guitar and have friends with children, please casually have a discussion with them about things to avoid in a learner guitar for their children. It is criminal that products this bad can be so widely sold under the disguise of thousands of overwhelmingly positive reviews. I see these every January, but this year I've seen more than ever before. I feel bad for the parents as well. For the money they spent on this junk, they could have been halfway to buying a really good quality 3/4 size instrument for their child. Or, they could have just gone to a local pawn shop and picked up some inexpensive used instrument that I could have gone through and done a setup on to make sufficient.

The last thing available to sell was his guitar, we‚Äôd already sold everything else we didn‚Äôt use/need. 
I tried talking him out of it but he didn‚Äôt use it much anymore, it was just an object that he loved to have around as a memory, and I think having those things is important.

I have a fender blues jr amp with some pedals,  a spark amp, and neural dsp amps for the computer. Out of these 3 amps the fender blues jr with the tubes sounds the best, then comes neural dsp, then the spark amp. The one I use the most though is the spark amp for the simple fact that I can go to the tone cloud and w.e song im playing I can get that same sound immediately.

Neural dsp has some presets, but not many and online people make some presets you can download, but again not a big list.

When I play guitar I mostly enjoy playing along to my favorite songs. Is there a better quality amp that has a great preset library or a tone cloud that has sounds for specific bands, for example Metallica, Arctic Monkeys?

Seems like Hughes and Kettner GrandMeister Deluxe 40 seems to be exactly what I am looking for, but I am terrible at dialing in tones and I havent seen an option for downloading presets. Also the H and K triamp mark 3 looks amazing as well, but I run into the same issue with dialing in tones.

Is there anything out there like the spark amp tone cloud but for something with better sound quality like a tube amp or close to it?"

The locking boxes are off. The strings are all loose and the bridge is leaning back, so I'm tuning the guitar starting with low E and going up since the thickest strings feel the safest to tug onto the bridge first. I go one by one trying to get them in tune but I switch to the next string when I feel like the string goes too stiff and might break. I can get most of the strings right but the G string is fairly out of tune and I feel like I might break it if I keep tuning.

To be fair, I already broke the G string once, put a new in and at one point I took it down, put it back with slightly more slack and still can't do it.

guitar,"I might be an atypical case.

I struggle to sustain clean 16th notes at 120 bpm while warmed and when I switch sides, my left hand reaches 140 bpm with more strength and consistency with little training.

My right arm feels pretty weak when I think about as my upstrokes with it sound weaker and I have to work on that. My speed goes even slower if I decide to angle my hand to pick in the direction of the guitar (USX according to Troy Grady's notation). I tried changing angles, anchor on the bridge, trying other picks, and lots of variables concerning the pick and even the optimal with some practice is only able to reach for now the above mentioned speed.

I only noticed late in life that I am a lefty, as I was taught to write with my right hand in my infancy. When I was told that I had a tendency to try to write with the left hand, besides other signs and tests, everything made sense: I am a lefty. Made even more sense when I saw that the dominant hand should be the picking hand.

That being said, I gave up guitar on my 20s (starting at 17 or 18) due to my speed limitation. I am now 34yo and I bought an acoustic guitar on the pandemic and I was loving to play it and etc. but I noticed that I would have speed limitations or at least work to make it out.

I maybe have, in total, 4 years of practice and now I am considering switching due all the context I shared in this post. I am facing this dilemma for days as it's a bummer to start on square one.

So, before doing that, I need your insights and help to make my decision.

Does anyone here is also left handed but plays as right handed and really struggled with speed? If so, did you overcome this issue or your tremolo picking is limited to a low range BPM even stressing out many methods and lots of practice?"

I wonder why they discontinued it? I knew lots of people who loved it and its sub $100 price tag.

Ive been looking into other zoom products but cant tell if it uses the same models."

TL;DR: I tangled up the string end after it broke in that point

I got some 010 local-brand strings in Argentina that were like three times cheaper than some Daddario's, obviously I knew they were crap but I bought them since, well, my economic situation isnt that good. I only needed the 1st string since I had broken my high E the day before and the rest of the set was pretty much new, the set I bought came with a extra 010 as it's recurrent in some brands. I put the string in and after two weeks of rocking hard it snapped on the post when bending, I didn't blame the string since it had happened me before, I guess I've got a sharp edge there and I'm working in it. I put the new string today and after playing like 5 minutes, I did a 1 tone (or maybe a very very bit more but nowhere close a 1¬Ω) and string WEIRDLY popped in its back end, where the small metal ball is. I realized about this and got very upset (yk how we argentines are) because I hadn't ever have a string to break in that point, and i started blaming the brand desperately.

But then, an idea crossed my mind and i decided to try arranging the small ball as its originally done in the factory, winding the string around it and then tangling the end around itself with some tweezers. It has worked so far, besides I haven't got enough nuts to bend further than 1 tone yet.

 I know Im probably not the first guy to do this but I decided to share it because lol. Also excuse me for the language errors since English is not my first language."

guitar,"Read through recent and older posts but didn't find much on electric guitars and HIGH humidity. 

I'm in southern California and we've been having more rain than usual this winter. The hygrometer in my room has been between 60-75% RH since the beginning of December, temperatures have been around 60F. Given the stable weather we usually have, I hang my guitars on my wall year round, never had an issue, including last winter. A couple of weeks back however, one of my Strats started developing some checking near the trem base plate. Since then the checking has increased in size and shown up in other spots on the guitar.

Now, in all honesty I love the look of checking, so I was pretty excited to see the guitar develop some natural character, but I had always understood that paint usually cracks under extreme temperature changes or when the guitar is dried out by low humidity. In my case, my guitars never experience either; temperatures are consistent and humidity has been high instead of low. I also had understood that concerns with high humidity were more for acoustics than solid body electrics. But given my current experiences are contrary to what I thought was true, I'm second guessing myself.

**So my real question is:** need I worry about structural damage to the guitar? 

As I said, if the finish cracking is the extent of the damage I should expect, I have no problems and in fact eagerly look forward to more checking. But if the checking is instead signs of something more problematic happening to my guitar I definitely want to take any necessary steps to protect my instrument.

For reference I included some pictures of when the checking started forming in late December (first two pics) vs what it looks like right now.

I still am not too sure on what it means. I recently also found out that apparently people replace their bridge and other stuff like that. Wild.

I do not know a lick of music theory besides (very slowly) naming the notes of each fret. I learned the Egyptian Scale a few years ago and forgot it! No one that plays guitar around me really knows about the instrument.

I thoroughly enjoy myself when I play, with what little time I have to spend on it. I have wrote a few songs and learned several! Last year I figured that you are supposed to mute the strings when picking so that there's no stray sounds flying out. I am hoping someone can show me the way to play the guitar like a normal person.

I didn't know about all this other stuff years ago, and feel as if I could be considered a newbie at this point. I've only recently realized a bunch of stuff in my life that I've been doing is wrong and unnatural and I've only just now stopped it. I can't remember that far back."
guitar,"I went a little crazy buying gear in the past year. I got some fantastic deals on some stuff I really like, but do to my financial situation, it doesn't look like I can keep all of it. I've basically narrowed down what I'm going to get rid of to one guitar. I play it a lot, but it feels the most replaceable if I let it go--a MIM 70s classic series strat. I have a few other nice electric guitars, so it's not as though selling it means I won't have anything to play, but it still bums me out. I've owned other strats in the past, but I love the chunky neck, pickups,  vintage frets, and large 70s headstock on this one. But I'm telling myself I can get another decent strat in the future some time when I can afford it. I \*could\* sell my American tele instead, but I know if I do, I'll never be able to get another one close to the same price I paid, and I like having a tele! What to do?!

Anyone else ever have to sell a guitar that you really didn't want to sell? How'd you deal with it?"

There's also effects pedals that will let me cut out the iOS/MacOS middleman where I plug my guitar and then use the aux in for the music.

Yesterday I got a Yamaha Pacifica 112V gifted to me from a relative, who has passed. Sadly the guitar is a left-handed model, but I have heard you can modify it to fit it for right-handers by flipping the nut and changing the string order. Would it be worth it or is it still irritating because of the button alignment and the whammy bar? (Haven't used one before, so I don't know if it feels right or wrong). Also, am I able to use the strap in any way if i hold the guitar upside down or do I have to pass?"

guitar,"I have a long history with the guitar. I have been playing the guitar for 13 years of my 25 years of life, so I am no beginner persee, I've even been in music school for 5 semesters with a degree on guitar but dropped out for audio engineering and music production, so I am technically a producer.

I like to think that I have a lot of ability on the guitar, and can come up with riffs and melodies pretty easily, almost every time I play the guitar I come up with something. This comes very handy as a producer since I can come up with ideas pretty easily, the problem is that I don't have any idea of what I am playing, at least a vague one, like the type of chords I am playing and such. I never had problems in jam sessions with artists since I know my way on the fretboard, even on high tension moments with meeting new artists and such in studios.

I want to better my music theory so I can do more complex stuff such as complex chord voicings, modulations, and maybe some scales.

This all surged because I am a Radiohead fan I want to do more interesting stuff with chord progressions and voicings hehe.

guitar,"Well, it seems I‚Äôve messed up. I‚Äôve owned many amps over the years, starting off with several cheap solid state amps and then a few affordable tube amps. Currently I own 9 different amps, none worth more than maybe $600. 

The important ones to note: Fender Princeton Chorus, Peavey Bandit 112, Marshall Origin 20C, Fender Hot Rod Deluxe IV, Laney VC30, and a Crate Vintage Club 50. I still own all but the Marshall and Crate.

The first ever tube amp I had was the Crate. The thing sounded awesome, but it also chewed through power tubes in hours, so it wasn‚Äôt feasible to keep. It got replaced with the Marshall. The Marshall was amazing, but between the 10 inch speaker and lack of two channels, I sold it for the HRD. The HRD is great, but as it turns out, it‚Äôs basically a one channel amplifier. The Laney is much the same.

I‚Äôve been currently debating on which tube amp to keep, since the Laney and HRD are very similar in concept. I‚Äôve spent the past few days AB‚Äôing the two, and while the HRD sounds better, it needs to be much louder to be good. Both have usable drive sections, but you have to change the eq so much that it ruins the clean channel. So you pick one or the other and leave it.

Then, this morning I pulled out my Peavey Bandit. It‚Äôs one of the silver stripe ones with the transtubes and Sheffield speaker. I hate to say it, but I think it‚Äôs just a better amp. I‚Äôve been kicking myself over it because it‚Äôs an affordable solid state, but it‚Äôs the truth. 

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, the drive channel isn‚Äôt as good as cranking the Origin 20, but it‚Äôs also way more usable than the Laney or the HRD, simply because it doesn‚Äôt have some weird eq thing going on. Also, unlike the Origin 20, I can have both cleans and crunch. There‚Äôs even separate eq for both channels and an attenuator. It also does the edge of breakup sound well on the clean channel. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ever gonna buy another cheap tube amp. Maybe I‚Äôll sell the HRD and Laney and get a two channel amp with eq for both channels, but otherwise it just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it anymore."
guitar,"Hello all, if you are reading this I hope you are having a good day.

I am forming a band with a fellow drummer and guitar player. The only problem is we don‚Äôt have a bass player. It‚Äôs not too big of a deal since we‚Äôre just doing this as a fun thing, and don‚Äôt plan on playing gigs anytime soon.

Anyways, I‚Äôm trying to help this issue by adjusting my guitar tone to compensate for the lack of bass. I‚Äôm trying to model my tone from AJFA (Metallica), but obviously don‚Äôt want to copy the exact tone, so I can have my own personal tone.

Do you guys have any recommendations on distortion pedals/other accessories to help with this?

Or is there another device that I need to connect to?

Several months ago my amp was retubed to run a matched pair of E34L power tubes, an ECC83S in V1 and V2, ECC83 MG in V3 and an ECC803S in V4.

We're researching to help answer age-old questions about musical timbre and the words we use to describe them. We plan to do this by ditching the old knobs on our amplifiers and using English adjectives to change the guitar timbre.

You will be able to modulate the 'warmth' or 'chunkiness', or brittleness, of the guitar tone, of course, without having to learn 100s of pedals and amplifiers out there. You control the guitar tone just by using English words!

We have completed the first stage of the research, where we attempt to make a guitar clip sound more like an adjective, e.g., make a music clip sound more ‚Äò*warm*‚Äô or more ‚Äò*distorted*,‚Äô etc. We have included 110 English adjectives in this research.

We need your help to evaluate the results of our research and improve the Machine Learning tools we are developing.

I‚Äôve never been fully ‚Äúgood‚Äù at palm muting so to speak, but runs where the bottom string is covered for more fast picking is throwing me off, as I‚Äôm just not sure how to place my hand. Is it better to cover all the strings still and curve my wrist, or better to only cover the bottom string with a portion of my hand so it can remain in a more natural position rather than curving it?"

guitar,"Hi all I bought 2x kramer sm 1 first one had paint imperfections near the bridge pickup and tremolo cavity.
Second one came with a ripple in the paintwork on the back neck of the guitar looks like a nail mark.
Wood was bumpy on back of neck under the first fret area.
Intonated terribly.
One fret was not the same height as the others.
And a few minor scratches.

And the neck of the guitar wasn't straight it was twisted. 

Bought from a shop where I asked them to qc before sending and set up the guitar but they didn't but the worst part is they are selling it as b stock now and raised the price higher than I paid for.

I found one of these guitars left here in the uk in another shop and the best thing is you can inspect the actual guitar by photo on the website, and best of all they inspect all guitars and provide free setup and won't dispatch if they find anything wrong with it.

Are all the various selections of pickups marketing or do they really sound different? I'm NOT talking about the single coil vs humbucker difference or the passive vs active difference.

guitar,"Hello people i want to adress a problem which seems to be kinda common but I'm not soo sure...

I bought myself a new Fender AM Pro ii Stratocaster and discovered a deadspot on the G string on the 14th fret. I don't mean a high or bad croned fret. I'm talking about a tone that hits the natural frequency of the wood in the guitar so the tone has noticeably shorter sustain and often falls into the overtones.

I could still return the guitar, however i read that this is a common problem with many electric guitars around the 14th fret. I guess there is a good chance that a new guitar will have the same problem. I compared it to my other guitars (Ibanez, G&amp;L) and noticed that they have the same problem with certain tones in that area that ring out quicker. 

Some research to the topic reveals that this seems to be pretty normal, however i feel like not too many people know about this. So either many people don't notice it at all, or there are indeed more guitars without annoying dead spots.

My clip on tuner (adds weight to the neck) shifts the deadspot from the A to the G (12th fret). 

Now i wonder how common is this problem really? Maybe some people here would like to do a little experiment themselves. Test your tones from the 10th fret on the g string upwards and watch out for deadspots / bad resonance points.

Would be thankful for some input."

long time player here, I typically gravitate toward dual humbucker floyd rose guitars around the $1k price point. Jackson Pro Series are right up my alley as far as the type of playability and sound I expect from a guitar.

Basically, is the body of a cheap JS series Destroyer worth loading with upgraded hardware or am I better off buying a higher quality guitar?

guitar,"I'm interested in a Les Paul (or similarly shaped) guitar, but a significant concern for me is the guitar angle when standing. Without getting into my life story, I have to play with the guitar at a decent angle. Guitars with stap buttons on the horn, and that are angled somewhat toward the neck, produce angles that are perfect. But the top strap button on LP's don't seem conducive to this unless you're willing to manhandle the guitar Slash-style. 

Is there's a solution that results in the guitar naturally hanging from the strap at more of an angle, like that of S-style guitars?"

guitar,"As the title says - there was some delightfully cheesy guitar-based movie that I saw on VH1 in the early aughts. 

It was basically a poorly done rip-off of Crossroads where a young guitar virtuoso finds himself in some trouble and is back against a wall with a demon or perhaps the devil himself.

A pivotal scene I remember is near the end with the guitarist playing off sheet music until his fingers bleed, and while he‚Äôs playing the blood drips on the sheet to create more notes. It‚Äôs SO fucking bad but I‚Äôm dying to find it again.

If anyone could be of help, that would be great!"
guitar,"So, I've been playing classic guitar for years now, and I'm thinking of getting an electric one but I have not found anything in popular brands that would get my attention. Not to forget that I still don't have a specific genre in my mind but I enjoy rock better than others."
guitar,"I got a new Fender mustang LT25 a few days ago and the first day was fine. When changing presets to more of a 'rocky/metal' sound it also had a little static noise going on which I suspect is normal. However last night during playing I noticed the quite loud static noise when not touching any metal parts of the guitar, on the ''fender clean'' preset, much more noticable than on the more rock sounding presets the day before, without changing any of the settings/volume knobs.

The static buzz goes away completely when touching any metal part, and the weird thing is that sometimes without doing anything different the buzz isn't there anymore, only for it to come back a few minutes later. 

The first time it happend i couldnt seem to get it to go away. When i switched the power outlet nothing changed, then when I went back to the one it was in before the static buzz was suddenly gone, but after about 15 minutes of play it reappeared.  when the buzz is present, switching to more rocky sounding presets the buzz gets louder, just like when I turn up the volume/master volume.

Is this a guitar related problem, power outlet (grounding?) or is it a problem with the amp itself? Is there any way for me to find out how to fix this?"
guitar,"I just bought a DI Box from Behringer (I know i should go for radial but hear me out) and i can confirm that the DI box DOES WORK PROPERLY cuz it can record a clean signal just fine through my zoom L12. The Zoom L12 mixer can record audio independent from the computer, and works just fine with the DI.

The issue comes when I boot my PC. Once the PC boots, moving the mouse causes a signal to be picked up by my guitar amp, and running my DAW (FL Studio) also causes noise to be picked up.

Things i have tried:

\- Moving the PC, Zoom L12 and amp to the same outlet via surge protector  
\- Moving the PC to a different outlet from Zoom L12 and amp  
\- Lifting ground  
\- Used different XLR cables  
\-Removing RGB from case  
\- swapping USB cables  
\- Turning monitor off

guitar,"I want to upgrade my MIM, bridge looking for an aluminum pickguard and upgraded bridge. Any recommendations welcome"
guitar,"The title of the post is both true and false and that's the damnable misery of it. This might be a little long so apologies upfront.

I've played guitar for about 15 years. Started when I was 12, where I basically just learned to play tabs and learn the mechanics of the guitarists in the bands I loved (mainly metal and rock). My guitar teacher that I had briefly when I was child could tell I did not have the desire nor the focus to learn the music and the guitar itself, just to learn the songs I liked. So that's what I've done... for 15 years now. Tabs. I've become quite a good mechanical player of the years and there isn't much in the way of me learning the songs I want to learn at this point.

You might think, ""Hell, you don't need to read music to play that kind of music or guitar in general"". That's not my issue... I don't know anything about music. I couldn't tell you the name of a single note on the fretboard, I don't have any scales memorized, I don't know the names of my chords, nothing. Couldn't tell you what key I'm in at any given point. I stopped playing a few years ago because of this fact. I plateaued really hard and felt pretty depressed that 95% of my thousands of hours on the guitar have been wasted, as far as my development is concerned.

I picked up my guitar again a few months and decided I was going to take a lesson here in my city to see if I could get some help. I had the lesson yesterday... The instructor was impressed with my playing when we first sat down and then he was uhh... moderately perturbed that I had absolutely zero clue what I was playing and that a guy with as many years under my belt on the guitar doesn't even know the fretboard, scales, or the names of chords. It was embarrassing, to say the least. I'm not going back to the lessons, I don't even feel like I have the fundamentals to make lessons worth the cost.

Where do I go from here? I guess memorizing my scales and learning the fretboard. The problem, I want to understand the context, WHY is this scale this way? WHY are things named the way they are? I just have a lot of questions and feel stuck. Music itself just doesn't make any sense to me.

With all of that rambling aside, what resources do you guys recommend? I need to learn music theory concepts that I can apply to my playing as I learn them. If I can't do that then I'll probably never be able to reach my potential as a player.

TL;DR: recommend your best music theory resources for a music novice with 15 years worth of mechanics... lol"
guitar,"Right off that bat I only know that you need a guitar and amplifier.

But what should I look for in an electric guitar? What's a normal price range for a beginner? 

What kind of amp? Is it normal that every one I've seen costs 600$? What's the deal with amps over all? Can one produce multiple kinds of sounds? 

Any additional cables and stuff that I would need? 

Any cheap but good enough brands?"
guitar,"I want to start playing electric guitar soon and don't know anything. I had 2 years of (unsuccessful) acoustic guitar lessons as a kid ~5 years ago.

guitar,"I'm playing doom/stoner metal on it and l'm using daddario 12-60 nyxls playing in B standard but no matter how much I try to stretch out the strings and play them, the tuning always seems to get whacked.

guitar,"Here is my Problem at the moment: I have been playing guitar now for some time since I was young (roughly 20 years with frequent and BIG gaps in between though), so I would call myself a somewhat intermediate player. I have a whole bunch of cover songs that I can kind of play and love to noodle around with, when practicing. But I can‚Äôt play a lot of them really good, so from the beginning to the end, some also just big parts of it. This has been going on for quite some time now. Probably because I am not a structured learner and usually just play what is fun to me.

So I am asking myself: how do I get from here to the point of building a decent repertoire with these cover songs for a live set? So a set of songs that I am really comfortable with and am able to play so good, that I could perform them. Do you have any tips on that?"
guitar,"Hi all!

I intend to buy a 7 string in some time. I currently play on a 6 string, 25.5"" scale, in drop A on D'Addario NY XL 12-60. On said 7 string, 27"" (not multi-) scale, I want to play in Drop E. What strings/string gauge would you recommend in general and especially for that low E string to not be too wobbly?

Thanks in advance!"
guitar,"I am comfortable switching simple open chords over basic strumming patterns. So I can play along some beginner-level songs. No barre/movable chords yet.

I have background in mathematics so following music theory isn't an issue. In fact, I find the theory lessons very interesting. But the reality is without practice knowing a lot of theory doesn't make a good player.

I try practicing scales (C major in open position, G major, A minor) but don't know exactly very much on how to best make use of them in soloing or improvising.

On the other hand, there's techniques for finger-style, arpeggios, blues/jazz, string bending etc. So I'm confused on what to focus on next.

Plus there are thousands of videos on YT about different exercises one should do daily, which creates more confusion.

Please let me know if you have advice, tips, lessons plans (with YT links) for a beginner who is self-learning guitar."
guitar,"Hi. I'm considering getting a following setup:

An amp &amp; effects modeller + poweramp (Harley Benton GPA-100) + 2x12 passive cabinet (Hesu 2x12).

As for the modeller, I already have a Line6 POD HD500, but consider switching to a POD GO. I also have a Yamaha THRII 30 which features line outs.

I'm not really into active modelled cabinets as there are few options available and thus was thinking about getting a passive cab and a not-so-expensive poweramp. The cab may be also useful in case I decide in the future to use a guitar cab instead of a modeller.

What do you think about this config?"

guitar,"Soooo I've been saving up some money to buy some guitar stuff, but I came across two things I'm interested in: 
1. Digitech Whammy DT 
2. SubZero Rogue VI
I really don't know which one to buy first, I will eventually get both, but a lot of time will pass between the two purchases. Here are the pros for both of them:
1. I already have both a normal guitar and an 8 string, and I think the Digitech would make downtunig a lot easier and would give me a lot fewer problems with tension. It would also allow me to play stuff I wouldn't be able to play without it (Vildhjarta, HLB ecc.).
2. On the other end, the SubZero would delete all problems with string tension, and the sound would be a lot clearer than the 8 string. In general, it would open a new world in my guitar playing.
Which one do you think I should buy first?

tl;dr: I don't know whether to buy a Digitech Whammy DT or a SubZero Rogue VI"

As a guitarist, does your favorite artist influence your writing or playing?


Ive taken influences from a lot of artists and guitarist over the years, mostly 90s era stuff when I startes playing, and my original rig was heavily influenced by my favorite artist at the time. But as I've grown as a musician and a person I've noticed that the guitarists most influential in my writing for the past couple of years are not even favorite bands. 

Favorite band/artists: Thrice (Dustin kensure), Dan Mangan, Matthew Good (upto hospital music). 

Yet my major influences currently are: Mark Holcomb (Periphery), Chris Sheffli (Foo Fighters), and Jason Mraz. 


I love thrice, they have continued being my favorite band since the artist and the ambulance was released. But I've rarely if ever have tried to learn their tunes nor do I consider them an influence in my writing. Matthew Good was when I was first picking up the guitar. But otherwise most of the stuff I have tried to learn over the years has been not even related to my favorite bands. 

How about you?"
